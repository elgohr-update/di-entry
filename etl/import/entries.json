Because they wrote stuff down in journals and letters. It's a happy accident that the only mode of doing so has historically been ink and paper, which lasts through time near and distant.\n\nIn the present saturated with social media where we \"document\" everything, do we have the same level of documentary coverage? Can far future historians understand us or our culture? Probably not, if all they see is contrived online performances/personas in data that will not last through time. If an archeologist wants to understand a figure contemporary to us, what would they learn from Facebook? Could they even see the data stored on proprietary systems if the encryption keys have long since been lost?\n\nJournaling is important to understand the present for ourselves and for others to understand their past. However, the value of this is based on two things: 1. that people write down meaningful things, and 2. the documents remain through time. The second challenge can easily be accomplished as it has always been -- with paper and a pen. However, what about the first challenge when you have a notebook that you can forget at home or spill coffee on and ruin? There are too many barriers of entry and so many easier ways to write that feel more comfortable to us.\n\nThe purpose of this Web application is to encourage journaling from anywhere at any time towards an end of physical preservation. After a period of time -- a year, maybe -- print out all your entries onto physical paper and put it on your shelf.","timeCreated":"2017-01-11T14:10:53+00:00","userId":["58759d46f36d285ed998f155"],"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5876f7c9cdcb5614ce039e85"},"text":"Learning plan:\n\n- algebra \n- algorithms\n- linear algebra \n- calculus\n- software design patterns\n- basic computing hardware and organization\n- C\n- networking\n- Bash - grep \u0026 sed\n- compilers\n- statistics \n- data science \n- machine learning","timeCreated":"2017-01-12T03:28:09+00:00","userId":["58759d46f36d285ed998f155"],"__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-07-16T15:58:05+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"58778545cdcb5614ce039e86"},"text":"Future idea:\n\nBuild a college-level academic program: Engineering for the Visual Arts.\n\nPrepares students for he fields: web development, software engineering, data analytics.

The language we use is largely a reflection of what we already think and believe, not the other way around (i.e. our language is a function of our belief systems). As a corollary, changing your language through external means (punitive measures, shame, etc) is not likely to change your belief systems. BUT - growth of our belief systems DO change our language*. \n\nA little personal story to illustrate this and the confusion around the the \"War On Christmas,\" a common \"PC\" trope: I grew up in a primarily white, Christian suburb. After the holidays, I would often ask people: \"How was your Christmas?\" This always made sense, I never questioned it. Later, I moved to a city and went to college with a LOT of Jews. It only took one or two times asking \"How was your Christmas?\" and getting an awkward (not offended... just awkward) reply of, \"....well, I'm a Jew, so I don't do Christmas. But, my Hanukkah was great, thanks!.\" Turns out not everyone celebrates Christmas, and assuming \"Merry Christmas\" is the right greeting for most people is wrong. So now I usually say something like \"happy holidays\" instead, not because the liberal \"PC\" weenies** forced me to (as The O'Reilly Factor might have you believe), or out of a disrespect for the Christian holiday, but because my life experiences (spending time with non-Christians) changed the language I use. Is this being \"politically correct,\" or is it just good manners? I don't know.\n\n2. I agree that the term \"politically correct\" is over-used and basically meaningless, either when spoken as a pejorative OR a compliment. Point #1 shows it's not valuable for so-called \"politically correct\" liberal weenies to force \"PC\" language upon others, but ALSO, dismissing any offense taken or dissenting argument made as \"just liberal weenie PC nonsense\" short-circuits many useful discussions between parties.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n\"PC\" liberal weenies - don't deride people for using \"non-PC\" language! If something is offensive, wrong or mean, explain why you feel that way with words! Or better yet, model and normalize better language yourself!\n\nWhatever the opposite of a \"PC\" liberal weenie is - when someone calls you out because something you said was offensive, wrong or mean, gut-check your assumptions before throwing in the \"stop being so PC\" argument-stopper, and hear them out! They *might* be giving you the \"PC\" run-around, but also... maybe not. Confronting that (not dismissing it) is how both sides learn.\n\n----\n\n*To be fair, I think a lot of coastal liberal elites, for better or for worse (probably worse) have an insider-outsider stance on this -- you're either already IN the enlightened circle and therefore don't use what some might consider \"politically incorrect\" language, or you're OUTSIDE of the circle, and your \"politically incorrect\" language reveals it. I don't think this is fair, but it's definitely a thing, and I think it's the crux of why people find \"PC\" culture irritating. Honestly, I didn't really realize that until I wrote this.\n\n**I use this term half with affection and half to be provocative. It might not be \"PC\", but... I don't care ;)","timeCreated":"2017-01-26T13:01:16+00:00","userId":["58759d46f36d285ed998f155"],"__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-01-26T21:37:48+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"588b6823cdcb5614ce039e91"},"text":"In an America full of terrible people, national embarrassments, normalized \"alternative facts,\" I keep reminding myself that it's the same world that created Kendrick Lamar's \"Momma.\"\n\nThis track is giving my the chills right now, restoring my faith in humanity.","timeCreated":"2017-01-27T15:32:51+00:00","userId":["58759d46f36d285ed998f155"],"__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-01-28T04:18:16+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"588bd9eacdcb5614ce039e93"},"text":"Code complete this week.

Prevent a passion or interest in a marjority\n2. The majority, having coexistent interests by their number and various local circumstances, are unable to actuate \"schemes of oppression\"\n\n- Direct democracies can't do #2 - passions will take hold in the majority, nothing to \"check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual\"\n- However, a Republic with representative democracy can fix this\n\nDifferences between republic and democracy are:\n1. delegation of government to small number of citizens elected by the rest\n2. greater number of citizens and sphere of country included as constituents of the representatives\n- #1 can \"refine and enlarge\" the public views by passing them through a medium with discretion. They can focus better on the public good than the people alone can.\n- #2 extends the sphere of politics and creates more varied interests which make it less likely that a majority faction will arise that takes rights away from others, or at least less likely that they are able to work together to enact it.\n\n** It seems like the Founders focused on States as the key unit to consider faction and drew strong lines between state and federal government as a remedy. Do state boundaries still pose the same problem now? What happens when the lines of faction are less clearly defined and can seep into the federal government directly?\n\n14\nFederal government can rule over a large territory because it is a republic rather than a democracy\n- \"The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\"\n\n23\n\"This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches—the objects to be provided for by the federal government, the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects, the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head.\nThe principal purposes to be answered by union are these—the common defense of the members; the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States; the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.\"\n- These powers should exist without limitation because we can't foresee what specific powers will be necessary in the future\n- \"the MEANS ought to be proportioned to the END; the persons, from whose agency the attainment of any END is expected, ought to possess the MEANS by which it is to be attained.\"\n\n39\n\"whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican\"\n- What does it mean to be republican?\n  - \"a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.\"\n- \" It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic\"\n- ** What about when only rich people form the government? What does this mean for Citizen's United?\n- The Constitution IS republican - the House is elected by the people, the Senate, President and Judges indirectly from the people\n\nBUT should the Constitution also preserve the Federal form of government, \"which regards the Union as a CONFEDERACY of sovereign states; instead of which, they have framed a NATIONAL government, which regards the Union as a CONSOLIDATION of the States.\"\n- The act establishing the Constitution must be ratified by the states, so it's a FEDERAL act, bot a NATIONAL one.\n- The sources from which the powers of government are to be derived\n  - the House from the people -- NATIONAL\n  - the Senate from the states -- FEDERAL\n\nw.r.t. the operation of government\n- In federal government, \"powers operate on the political bodies composing the Confederacy, in their political capacities\"\n- In national government, powers operate on \"the individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual capacities\"\n- By this definition, in the operation of its powers, the Constitution creates a national government\n\nw.r.t. the extent of its powers\n- Legislature has authority over all people and things enumerated to them, but leave some things to the state and local governments\n- This is more FEDERAL\n\nThe Constitution isn't fully FEDERAL or NATIONAL, but a composition of both\n- \"Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union\"\n- \"Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence of each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all\"\n\n45\nIs the authority of the federal government a threat to the authority of the States\n- States intervene in election of the president\n- Senate is elected by the States\n- Doesn't go the other way -- the federal government does not directly appoint state-level legislators\n\n** Interesting how much the Founders emphasized giving power to the STATES as independent entities within the sphere of government, and less so PEOPLE themselves. I don't think people identify with their state governments like that anymore.\n\n- Few powers explicitly granted to Federal government; many more granted to the states\n- ** How does this relate to the process of incorporation?\n\n47\nDistribution of power among the parts of the federal government\n- 3 branches are separate and distinct\n- BUT they CAN have partial control over one another\n\n48\nIt's essential that the branches are blended to \"give to each a constitutional control over the others\"\n- \"The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands.\"\n\n51\n\"But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. \"\n\n- \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"\n\n- \" In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\"\n\n52\nThe House of Representatives\n\n- Biennial elections\n- Members of the House should \"have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people. Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.\"\n\n62\nThe Senate\n\nThe qualifications proposed for senators\n- Older and wiser than House of Representatives\n- \"The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages; and which, participating immediately in transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and education.\"\n- No foreign influence\n- ** This ^ was very important to Founders, but I don't think we think about it much anymore. But I think it's coming back.\n\nAppointment by state legislatures\n- Gives states agency and links the two systems\n- ** Again, interesting how this is NOT our perspective of the Senate anymore\n\nEquality of representation in the Senate\n- Lessor of two evils w.r.t. representation and state size.\n- \"In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty\"\n- Also protects against improper acts of legislation because it has to pass a majority of the people AND the States, which might have competing interests.\n- ** Again, I don't think we view this as a benefit to Congress anymore - House and Senate seem to be two version so of the same thing.\n\nNumber of senators and duration of appointment\n- As a corrective against sudden passions, senators aught to have more time in office\n- \"A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained.\"\n- provides stability against continuous change elsewhere (in the House)\n\n63\nMore Senate\n\nUtility of the Senate\n- \" Without a select and stable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the causes already mentioned, but the national councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and confidence.\"\n\nResponsibility of Senate\n- Some policy builds on itself over time, and the Senate is more prepared to do that with longer term limits\n\n64\nPowers of the Senate\n\n\"that the President and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand our national interests, whether considered in relation to the several States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence. With such men the power of making treaties may be safely lodged.\"\n\n70\n\"Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy.\"\n\nDeferring to a single person, not a plurality, in the Executive office is crucial to execution of its powers.\n- Disagreements would ensue\n- Would hide responsibility\n\n78\nThe Judiciary Department\n\n- The weakest of each branch of government\n- Therefore, it's continuously in jeopardy of being overpowered\n\n\"This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community.\"\n\n\"But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws.\"\n- Congress can sometimes pass laws that hurt people. The Judicial branch has a duty to protect them.\n- Can't do this effectively if judges only temporarily hold office","timeCreated":"2017-02-12T14:03:19+00:00","userId":["58759d46f36d285ed998f155"],"__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-02-17T12:25:54+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"58a2761dac439a602064c55f"},"text":"Yeah, so forms in react kind of suck. But it's not react's fault, I think implementing forms in general kind of sucks. Rails form helpers hide a lot of the suck, but I haven't yet found any libraries that generalize forms well with React. I think it's a harder problem to solve when forms are inputs for complex client-side state rather than purely RESTful.\n\nHonestly, I haven't really found a perfect pattern that works in all cases yet, but the different ways of doing it fall into 3 categories all dealing with where your form state lives and how it changes:\n\n1. Keep form state in the DOM, access data with refs, let the browser change it. This is the least useful way to handle forms. It works if you have very simple form needs, but if you have anything else that depends on your form state, this will not work because changing the form state does NOT trigger a re-render.\n\n2. Keep form state in local component state, change it with internal change handlers and setState. This is my go-to and where I suggest starting. There's kind of a lot of boilerplate, but there might be libraries to help with that. I can't recommend any. This works well when you have other dependencies on your form data within the same component, like if you need to show in-line validation errors, but it breaks down a bit if some other component in your component hierarchy is dependent on this same form state. You can get around that in most cases by passing data out with an onSubmit or onChange prop.\n\n3. Keep form state somewhere else and pass it in to the form with props, change it with an onChange handler. \"Somewhere else\" might be a parent component state or redux or mobx or whatever. This is handy if you have dependencies on your form data distantly in your component hierarchy. redux-forms is a library I've messed around with and seems promising, but I haven't had a real use for it yet. I wouldn't recommend starting here unless you know other components are going to need to know all or some of your form state. There's definitely use-cases for that, but often you can refactor it into #2.","timeCreated":"2017-02-14T03:14:37+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-02-15T12:29:07+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"58a30286ac439a602064c560"},"text":"A few observations:\n\n1.

I also think this jives with Madisonian philosophy of representative democracy (described in detail in Federalist no. 10) where the value of deputizing representatives in concentric circles of larger and larger constituencies holds majority faction in check because the representatives are beholden to wider and more diverse populations. The president, being the representative of the largest possible constituency, has a duty, then, to consider the interests and perspectives of all.\n\nThis, of course, is an idealized perspective of the executive branch. New presidents come in with agendas and outside interests and mandates to their supporters. But few come in riding on the shoulders of a fringe ultra-right nationalism mixed with a reluctant middle America desperate to find jobs. He has entered office acting as if there's a mandate to these people peddling baseless conspiracy theories, xenophobia, isolationism, etc. despite an actual majority of voters expressing discontent with these ideas at the voting booths. He appears unable to effectively work with Congress or his own staff and he'll listen to no one else, claiming he's \"the only one who understands\" and \"the only one who can fix it.\" This is not a centrist president. He's off the charts. I'll do whatever I can to bring it back to the middle *.\n\nMore ancillary frustrations are:\n\nI think a free press is essential to a functioning society and Trump's combative approach and rhetoric designed to erode faith in the institution amongst his supporters is a new kind of dystopian control mechanism. He has started doing the same thing with the entire judicial branch by attacking judges and pretending they don't have the authority to review his EO, which is simply not how the government works as explicitly stated by the Ninth circuit in their denial of stay. To me, this should be a bipartisan issue.\n\nHis erratic behavior during the campaign and in his first few weeks as president has been dangerous and unproductive. I'm embarrassed that a man like this is representing our country and I hope for better.\n\nI also think his refusal to release his tax returns is a bit strange. It makes me think he has something to hide. His insistence that \"nobody cares because I won\" is extra frustrating because of his 8 year quest to make people think they care about Obama's birth certificate based on nothing but racism.\n\n\n* You COULD argue the same point about Obama. I think you'd be wrong, but you can make the case. This doesn't change my opinion - if you felt he was an extreme leftist, you would have had every right to be angry and to protest (and many were and people did). That's fine, it's how American democracy works.","timeCreated":"2017-02-17T12:59:26+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-02-17T13:59:36+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"58aba501ac439a602064c563"},"text":"Great long weekend.

I'm not in support of this travel ban any more than most of you are, but please help me understand how it's an indictment against an entire religion, as indicated in the ruling. It specifies 6 countries, but there are many more that aren't banned that are also Muslim majority countries around the world. Arguably some more deserving of a ban (KSA). So walk my through this?\n\n# Jason Blanchard - The ruling (https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3518057/Order.pdf) is pretty clear on its logic on this:\n\n\"The illogic of the Government’s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\"\n\n....\n\nIn reference to another case:\n\n\"(rejecting the argument that “the Court cannot infer an anti-Muslim animus because [Executive Order No. 13,769] does not affect all, or even most, Muslims,” because “the Supreme Court has never reduced its Establishment Clause jurisprudence to a mathematical exercise. It is a discriminatory purpose that matters, no matter how inefficient the execution” (citation omitted)).\"\n\n...\n\n\"Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries. It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%.12 It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam. Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not.\"\n\n# Jason Blanchard - Plus the context of all the dumb shit that he said during the campaign.\n\n# Steve Skeldon - That's the totally unclear logic that I'm confused about. For it to be predominately against Muslims wouldn't the ban need to be further reaching than these six countries? That's like saying that restricting Italian immigration is distinctly prejudicial against Catholics, despite the fact that the majority of Catholics reside outside Italy.\n\n# Jason Blanchard - Steve Skeldon If you and your campaign consistently used rhetoric that was discriminatory against Catholics and you concocted a flawed national security reason to ban immigration from Italy, initially with an explicit preference for non-Catholics, than I would say yeah, that would appear to be an expression of prejudice against Catholics in general.\n\n# Jason Blanchard - Steve Skeldon Another way to think about it is:\n\n- Not ALL American blacks lived in southern districts with Jim Crow laws, but Jim Crow laws that targeted southern blacks was discriminatory against black Americans in general.\n\n- No ALL Jews lived in Germany, but systematically exterminating Jews in Germany (and surrounding areas) was discriminatory against Jews in general. (Sorry... not trying to invoke Godwin's law here, just using an extreme case to make my point).\n\nIn either case, it's a bit of a value judgement about the intentions behind those acts w.r.t. who it targets or harms, but certainly on the table given cost of ignoring it.\n\n# Steve Skeldon - I get that it's based on more than just the EO, but the court language seemed specifically around the EO, which is where the logic fell short.\n\n# Jason Blanchard - Hmm... I did not get that from reading the ruling. Section B \"The Executive Order’s Primary Purpose\" (and a few other places, I think) pretty clearly considers the context (not jus the text of the EO) as being relevant.\n\nWhich, btw, I think is hugely important given how much the POTUS and his administration says crazy shit, seemingly without consequences.","timeCreated":"2017-03-16T16:24:57+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58d06cd53579f75e0dbb124d"},"text":"Trip to NYC:\n\n- Friday -- Day off work, took Amtrak from PHL -\u003e NYC in the morning.

It's now in a hip corner of the city with high rents. The corner he was born on, a few streets over, is now a fancy brunch place. We got to talking to a 30-something guy sitting on his stoop next door. We told him he's still alive, 93 years old. \"They don't make people like our grandparents anymore,\" he said. \"They were strong, solid people.\"\n\nAlso a few blocks away sits the Tenement Museum, so we took a tour that put the early 20th century Lower East Side immigrant life in more context. Or maybe more contrast is the right word.\n\nOne thing that I keep thinking back on is just how much distance there is between My Grandpa Harry's childhood in the 1920s and mine in the 1990s/2000s. Everything about it - the hopes, dreams, concerns, struggles, opportunities, technologies - are just so astoundingly different.\n\nI wonder what happens as generations grow more distant from the struggles of their ancestors? What gets lost when our grandparents' dream of their kids' life being better than theirs, and their kids' kids' lives being even better, reaches its logical conclusion? What happens when the comfort and leisure that our grandparents worked so hard for is handed to us in such a way that we can't fully appreciate what it took to get there?\n\nI'm struggling to have perspective on this. Grandpa's family lost children, emigrated from a country with a fascist government to a place where they didn't speak the language, just for a job. They struggled to put food on the table, probably worked much more than an 8 hour work day, wondered if they could possibly fit in America at all -- presumably motivated by the promise of a better life for their kids, the American dream. When our lives now are so deeply saturated by artificial input because we just don't need to care about any of these things anymore, how can we appreciate the opportunity they gave us? How do we honor it? What do we have left to hope and strive for? How can we possibly envision a better life for our kids?\n\nWhat have we lost if we can't know how to struggle for something?","timeCreated":"2017-03-24T00:40:07+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-03-24T01:00:03+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"58d6eb743579f75e0dbb1251"},"text":"Nicole and I rarely fight, but we've both been grumpy today for unrelated reasons.

The teaching/learning model is different now, and stakeholders are looking for more interesting and valuable online learning experiences, not just a course repository.\n- -8 Net Promoter score - that's bad\n\nHow it relates to Practice: \n- Special for me because LMSs being bad let me to become a developer\n- Two things that differentiate us from the LMS model:\n\n1. We provide a much more structured learning exercise experience. We have a methodology about a way of practicing and learning that works, and our platform does that. Instead of trying to do a million different things, our product does one thing well.\n\n2. We are able to build great authoring tools that scaffolding the process of creating learning exercises, PLUS an amazing CS team to help think through the process.\n\nOur product does fewer things, but it creates better results, and I think that's valuable in this market landscape.\n\n\n6) A New Learning Architecture Has Emerged: With New Vendors To Consider\n\nOverview: Since the LMSs aren't the center of the online learning space anymore, people are architecting their learning solutions with more diverse kinds of systems. This comes from the realization that learning experiences come from lots of different places, not just a centralized content repository. He puts these into 3 categories:\n\n1. \"learning experience” systems - curate learning content\n2. “learning delivery systems.” - modernized ways to interact with learning content\n3. “micro-learning platforms” - just-in-time learning tools, ways to find content when you need it\n\nHow it relates to our product:\n- We are more in #2 - we are a modernized way to interact with learning content and to measure and track learning experiences\n- but I think there's an opportunity to be in #1 and #3, they aren't mutually exclusive\n- It shows that integration and us plugging into other systems that do their own thing well\n\n\n8) A New Business Model for Learning\n\nOverview: The economics of the digital learning space has changed. Stakeholders aren't putting as much resources into what they think is the \"one best on-premise solution forever,\" instead they are buying shorter-term subscriptions to SASS software that they expect it to stay up-to-date.\n- \"This means you should demand that your vendors give you more flexibility on pricing\"\n\n\nHow it relates to our product:\n- Fewer big up-front investments into learning technologies means that they are less tied to any one product by necessity. This means that for them to stick with us, our software has to be GREAT \n- Some companies are using user-generated feedback to inform contract re-negotiations.\n- the learner is the consumer again.

As mentioned earlier, the people who agree with you will hit like, the people who disagree will scroll past (or eventually block you), so nothing actually gets accomplished beyond increasing the divide. I would encourage you to dig deeper. What's your endgame? Who do you believe in? How about posting news about the good stuff THAT guy/gal is doing, to encourage excitement about a future candidate? If no such person exists, how about becoming that person-- that would take REAL work, but-- more importantly-- it would require a positive spirit of change, rather than a negative spirit if tearing down. \"Let's do something great\" leads to communication; \"That shit sucks\" leads to arguments or shuts down conversation altogether.\n\nWalter Ramalho As a centrist myself, I agree with almost everything you said with a few caveats:\n\n1. I do not think Democracy ends with elections. There are a number of escape hatches codified in the Constitution designed to continuously hold elected officials accountable. They are structured as checks and balances plus our First Amendment rights to free speech, a free press, peaceful protest, etc. Personally, I'm not yet anticipating impeachment, but if things lead there, so be it - it's a perfectly valid action within the system our founders came up with.\n\n2. Running for office isn't the only way to participate in democracy. I'm not even 30. I know basically nothing. You'd be insane to vote for me. But that doesn't disqualify me for having an opinion or trying to have influence.\n\n\u003e Who do you believe in?\nGreat question, I'm still figuring that out. Any suggestions? Kamala Harris seems like a rising star. Cory Booker saved that lady from a fire, that was pretty cool. I've been agreeing with John McCain a lot lately? I'm digging PA Governor Tom Wolf, Philly mayor Kenney and Senator Bob Casey.\n\n\u003e What's your endgame?\nI think DJT is an unprecedentedly fraudulent, dangerous neophyte whose path into the White House, although legitimate within the rules we've set up for ourselves, is one of the most pointed examples of faction and demagoguery warned about by Madison in Federalist 10. To me, this goes beyond mere policy disagreements. So for now, my endgame is 1. to encouraging current elected officials to check this administration with extra vigilance (hence my sharing of this article, which I think is a pretty fair assessment of what's going on), 2. getting some of his supporters to flip (appears to be happening to some extent https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/ https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/863764599056805888), and 3. to fire up opposition in the 2018/20 election cycles, none of which seem particularly subversive to the ideals of a representative Democracy/republic. Keeping up the heat on his presidency and calling them out for odd behavior and bad policy is crucial.

IF - instruction fetch\n2. D - Decode the instruction\n3. ALU - perform the operation\n4. MEM - physical memory access\n5. WB - write back\n6. PC update - update the program counter\n\n\"Memory contains bytes. Some of those bytes are instructions, and some of those bytes are data.\nIn fact, one of the great ideas in computer science is the idea that programs could be stored just as data was stored. Before that, people envisioned the hardware running a fixed program, and data being stored in memory.\"\n\n- 1 byte is 8 bits, or an 8 bit bitstring\n- A bitstring with n bits has 2^n representations and a maximum value of 2^n - 1\n- Given a max value, you need ceil(log_2 n) bits where ceil(x) = n for the smallest integer where n \u003e= x in case n is not a power of 2\n- Even numbers in binary always end in 0\n\n- A n-1 multiplixer, or MUX, for short, is a device that allows you to pick one of n inputs and direct it to an output.\n- Demultiplexers (or DeMUX for short) are basically multiplexers where the inputs and outputs have been switched.\n- Almost every problem you can do with a MUX, you can do with a DeMUX\n\n- Half adder adds 2 bits and outputs the result and a carry using logic gates\n- Full adder adds 2 bits and a carry_in and outputs the result and a carry_out using logic gates\n- Ripple Carry Adders allows you to add 2 k-bit numbers using half and full adders and adding them one column at a time - starts with a HA for column 0 and then uses the carry_out as input for FAs for the remaining columns. Can also use a FA for column 0.\n- This adds UB representations and 2C\n\nOverflow  detection\n- When adding 2 UB numbers, you know it overflowed (i.e. results in a number larger than 2^k - 1 for 2 k-bit bitstrings) if the carry_out of the left-most adder is 1\n- When adding 2 2C numbers, you need to compare the sign bit and compare it to the sum, i.e. XOR the carry_in and carry_out bits of the left-most adder.\n\nCarry Lookahead Adders\n- Allow you to construct a circuit that adds numbers without having to connect carry_out bits. This is good because each addition can happen in terms of immediately available values and the add can happen in parallel, O(lg N) time.\n\n3-8 decoder\n- Uses a 3 bit inputs to make one of the 8 bit outputs 1\n- with Enable - if enable bit is 0, all outputs are 0. If enable bit is 1, works like a regular decoder\n- 1-8 DeMUX and 3-8 decoder with enable are essentially the same\n- Kind of: \"decoders convert from binary to unary, while encoders convert from unary to binary\"\n- Priority encoders allow us to encode values based on a priority scheme - if multiple bits are set to 1, pick either the first or the last one.\nState\n- Combinational logic circuits - boolean functions, output is entirely dependent on inputs\n- Sequential logic circuits - output is a function of inputs AND internal state\n- state = State is a quantity that stores the previous history of what's happened in such a way that you can predict the output, given any future input.\n\nFlip flops\n- Basic building block of sequential logic circuits - a device that can store 1 bit of information\n- Inputs = control bit(s) (D, T or JK), clock, Outputs = Q and Q+\n- D Flip Flop - Reset and Set\n- T Flip Flop - Hold and Toggle\n- JK Flip Flop - Hold, Reset, Set, Toggle\n- D and T flip flops are equivalent in the sense that \" you can implement the behavior of a single X flip flop using a single Y flip flop (plus logic gates) and vice versa\"\n- Output only changes at positive clock edges\n- Flip flops allow sequential circuits to have state (i.e., memory), which is something that combinational logic circuits do not have.\n\nParallel Load Register\n- Registers are made from flip flops\n- A parallel load register either holds the value of the outputs, or parallel loads the inputs to make them outputs. They can be designed with D or T flip flops, although it's easier to use D flip flops.\n\nFinite State Machines with Output\n- If a combinational logic circuit is an implementation of a Boolean function, then a sequential logic circuit can be considered an implementation of a finite state machine. \n- Moore machines - has outputs that are a function of state\n- Mealy machine - has outputs that are a function of state and input\n- You can convert between the two\n- CPUs use finite state machines as control units to sychronize the fetch, execute, decode cycle\n\nCache\n- Faster than RAM or disk\n- There are different caching schemes\n\nVirtual Memory\n- An abstraction between the memory addresses in RAM or disk a program/process is using and their physical addresses in memory. Allows OS to \"extend\" RAM to disk and as a means of memory protection.\n- Uses a page table where each page table entry is indexed by the first 20 bits of a 32 bit memory address\n- Each process gets its own page table\n- \"Each program can assume it uses the same set of 32 bit virtual addresses. We just make sure that those virtual pages do not map to the same disk page, nor to the same physical page\"\n- The OS manages page assignment\n- \"The virtual page number is the page used by the program. The physical page number is the page in RAM, if it is currently in RAM. The disk page number is the page in disk. \"\n\nI/O\n- CPU communicates with memory through a protocol. I/O devices can understand that same protocol so that it can write to memory and be written to by the CPU\n- \"Memory-mapped I/O uses a section of memory for I/O...Instead of having \"real\" memory (i.e., RAM) at that address, place an I/O device.\"\n- Volatile memory - \"A variable that's volatile is expected to change outside the program's control. Thus, it should not be kept in cache, because the cache may not see the updates.\"\n\nInterrupt driven I/O\n- I/O device sends an interrupt bit to the CPU, then the CPU asks the I/O device for an interrupt number. This corresponds to an interrupt handler subroutine/function which gets executed while the CPU stores the current execution context somewhere. Once it's done, the I/O device returns control to the CPU by setting the interrupt bit back to 0 at which point the CPU resumes normal execution.\n- Interrupt signals might go through a dedicated PIC (programmable interrupt controller) to manage interrupt signal handling from multiple I/O devices.\n- Software can also make interrupt calls\n- Interrupt driven I/O can be used instead of polling (having \"the CPU constantly check to see if the I/O device needs attention\" by \"reading a memory address which is associated with an I/O device (using memory mapped I/O)\")\n- Interrupt driven I/O should be used by devices that need to be serviced less frequently","timeCreated":"2017-07-14T11:37:08+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-07-26T11:47:39+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"596a0e543579f75e0dbb126d"},"text":"Message to Senator Pat Toomey -\n\nI wish to, once again, urge you not to vote for the healthcare bill being pushed through the Senate right now.\n\nNot only will millions be left uninsured due to medicaid cuts, but I fear the Cruz amendment will result in insurance companies selling junk plans that don't adequately cover basic needs.

Learning about \"for\" loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw.\"\n\n- \"People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.\"\n\nLearning environments should encourage both ^\n\n\nThe environment should allow the learner to:\n- read the vocabulary\n  - what do these words mean?\n  -  Is meaning transparent? Is meaning explained in context, by showing and telling?\n\n- follow the flow\n  - what happens when?\n  -  Is time visible and tangible? At all meaningful granularities?\n\n- see the state\n  - what is the computer thinking?\n  - Does the environment show the data? Show comparisons? Is hidden state eliminated?\n\n- create by reacting\n  - start somewhere, then sculpt\n  - Is something on screen as soon as possible? Is the parts bucket on the floor?\n\n- create by abstracting\n  - start concrete, then generalize\n  - Can the programmer start concrete, then generalize?\n\nThe language should provide:\n- identity and metaphor\n  - how can I relate the computer's world to my own?\n  -  Is the computer's world connected to the programmer's world?\n\n- decomposition\n  - how do I break down my thoughts into mind-sized pieces?\n  - Can the programmer break down her thoughts into mind-sized pieces?\n\n- recomposition\n  - how do I glue pieces together?\n  - Can the programmer put diverse pieces together?\n\n- readability\n  - what do these words mean?\n  - Is meaning transparent?\n\n\n\nREAD THE VOCABULARY\n- The environment should make meaning transparent, so the learner can concentrate on high-level concepts, not vocabulary.\n- The environment should explain in context. Show and tell. Annotate the data, not just the code.\n\nFOLLOW THE FLOW\n- The environment can make flow tangible, by enabling the programmer to explore forward and backward at her own pace.\n- The environment can make flow visible, by visualizing the pattern of execution.\n- The environment can represent time at multiple granularities, such as frames or event responses, to enable exploration across these meaningful chunks of execution.\n\nSEE THE STATE\n- The environment must show the data. If a line of code computes a thing, that thing should be immediately visible.\n- The environment must show comparisons. If a program computes many things, all of those things should be shown in context. This is nothing more than data visualization.\n- The system must have no hidden state. State should either be eliminated, or represented as explicit objects on the screen. Every action must have a visible effect.\n\nCREATE BY REACTING\n- AKA \"start with something, then adjust until it's right.\" \"The environment must serve as an external imagination, where the programmer can be continuously reacting to a work-in-progress.\"\n- The environment must be designed to get something on the screen as soon as possible, so the programmer can start reacting. This requires modeling the programmer's thought process, and designing a system that can pick up on the earliest possible seed of thought.\n- The environment must dump the parts bucket onto the floor, allowing the programmer to continuously react to her raw material and spark new ideas.\n\nCREATE BY ABSTRACTING\n- Allow the learner to experience controlling the lower-level details until they feel comfortable abstracting\n- The environment should encourage the learner to start constant, then vary, by providing meaningful ways of gradually and seamlessly transitioning constant expressions into variable expressions.\n- The environment should encourage the learner to start with one, then make many, by providing ways of using those variable expressions at a higher level, such as function application or looping.\n\nLANGUAGE\n\nIdentity and metaphor\n- Use good metaphors in the language so that learners can relate to  it.\n- i.e. the turtle in Logo\n\nDecomposition\n- \"A programming language must encourage the programmer to decompose -- to approach a complex problem by breaking it into simpler problems.\"\n\nRecomposition\n- \"A programming language must encourage recomposition -- grabbing parts of other programs, assembling them together, modifying them, building on top of them.\"\n\nReadability\n- \"A learner must be able to look at a line of code and know what it means.\"\n- \"Names matter\"","timeCreated":"2017-09-12T11:54:27+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-09-12T11:55:05+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59bfbc5dc93d5d6fb6ff98ca"},"text":"Thoughts on unit testing UI code:\n\nWhat is the purpose of unit testing? To programmatically assert the \"correctness\" of your program to assure you that it's working as expected.\n\nUnit testing computational code is simple: given some inputs, ensure that the code is producing expected outputs. For example, a simple add function:\n\noutput = add(1, 2)\nexpect(output).toEqual(3)\n\nIn this case, given the inputs 1 and 2, we expect the output to be 3. If it's *anything* other than 3, it's wrong. If it's producing the expected output, we can be reasonably sure that this piece of our program is working as expected, i.e. it is \"correct.\"\n\nAlso, notice that we're not testing implementation details, like that the add() function uses the binary + operator. That's because tying the test to the implementation is difficult to maintain (the implementation details may and often do change - you don't want to have to refactor the test code with it), but, more importantly, testing the implementation details tells you nothing about the correctness of your program with regard to inputs and outputs. It shouldn't matter how we got to 3 - if it still returns 3 (and all the other expected outputs given some inputs), it's correct.\n\nNow consider UI code - what are the inputs and outputs? How do we know the \"correctness\" of UI code?\n\nReact seems to make this easier - all UI code comes from render functions and so our inputs are the function arguments (i.e. props) and the output is the HTML string the render function returns. Thinking of it this way, unit testing is simple - given some inputs, does it return the expected HTML string? This is a simple scalar equality check like the add() function test above. It gets a little more complicated when the return value of your render function is dependent on internal state and DOM interactions. In my experience, this is enough of a barrier to leave me questioning the value of unit testing UI code, but, ultimately, it's a solvable problem.\n\nMore importantly, what does unit testing UI code like this tell us about the correctness of our program? Ultimately, we want to know if this UI component renders in a browser as expected. This complicates things because 1. it's not really a unit test anymore - it's more of an integration test between your UI code and a browser render engine, and 2. It's much harder to assert that UI code renders \"as expected\" - how do you assert that it looks like the mocks and doesn't render \"weird\"? The returned HTML string is kind of an approximation of this, but it's more like an implementation detail. Testing the HTML structure is more analogous to making sure the add function uses the binary + operator than it is asserting that the function returned 3.\n\nUltimately, unit testing UI code does not give the same assurances about the \"correctness\" of your program and therefore there's less assurance that it's working as expected.

Cocktails were in a small tent where Mike and I hunted down the snacks on trays. Reception was in a larger tent about 30 yards away. Live band was amazing. Food was good, but there wasn't much of it. After, buses took as back to Edgartown for the afterparty at The Wharf Pub. There was a live band there. Left around midnight and looked for food, but everything was closed. Almost got tacos at one place, but they were closed 5 minutes before.\n\nSunday - drove to the Blackdog Tavern in Vineyard Haven for brunch. They closed it down for us.  Loaded up on everything, then said by to Brian and Lily. Mike, Mel and Nate grabbed a noon ferry. We didn't have tickets until later that evening, but tried to get on an earlier one in Oak Bluffs. Walked around there for a bit and bout a Blackdog mug. Caught the ferry around 1:15pm and headed home. Stopped at Sally and Jim's for leftovers from his 50th birthday. Caught my Mom and John there.\n\nMonday - Took the day off work to drive back to Philly.","timeCreated":"2017-10-04T01:32:32+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-10-04T01:35:44+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59d615f4c128fe504ba880f1"},"text":"The Coming Software Apocalypse, by James Somers in The Atlantic\n\nThe big idea: more and more stuff is moving to software. Software is dangerous because its complexity is beyond what we can appreciate and understand. The means of thinking about and making software don't account for this complexity, and se we need new ways to make software and to ensure it's working correctly.\n\nWays to make programming better:\n1. Programming environments that make the creator closer to what they are creating via immediate feedback.\n2. Model-based design (or model-driven engineering, or MDE) where programmers and stakeholders write out what the software is supposed to do and code is automatically generated from this.\n3. Fully understanding complexity by mathematically proving systems completely work.\n\n\n----\n\n\"More and more, critical systems that were once controlled mechanically, or by people, are coming to depend on code.\"\n\nIn mechanical systems, people were able to think through all the possible states and exhaustively test them. \n\n\"Software is different. Just by editing the text in a file somewhere, the same hunk of silicon can become an autopilot or an inventory-control system. This flexibility is software’s miracle, and its curse. Because it can be changed cheaply, software is constantly changed; and because it’s unmoored from anything physical—a program that is a thousand times more complex than another takes up the same actual space—it tends to grow without bound. \"\n\n\"But software doesn’t break. Intrado’s faulty threshold is not like the faulty rivet that leads to the crash of an airliner. The software did exactly what it was told to do. In fact it did it perfectly. The reason it failed is that it was told to do the wrong thing. Software failures are failures of understanding, and of imagination.\"\n\n'“The complexity,” as Leveson puts it, “is invisible to the eye.”'\n\n\"There will be more bad days for software. It's important that we get better at making it, because if we don't, and as software becomes more sophisticated and connected—as it takes control of more critical functions—those days could get worse.\"\n\n\n## Getting programmers closer to what they are programming\nRight now, when programmers write code, they have to \"play computer inside their head.\"\n- \"Programmers were like chess players trying to play with a blindfold on—so much of their mental energy is spent just trying to picture where the pieces are that there’s hardly any left over to think about the game itself.\"\n\nJohn Resig of Khan Academy tried to make a better learnable programming environment that made the effects of the code more visible.\n\nBret Victor's \"Inventing on Principle\" - “Creators need an immediate connection to what they’re creating.” The problem with programming was that it violated the principle. That’s why software systems were so hard to think about, and so rife with bugs: The programmer, staring at a page of text, was abstracted from whatever it was they were actually making.\"\n\nPeople misinterpreted Victor's talk by developing elaborate IDEs:  “Everyone thought I was interested in programming environments,” he said. Really he was interested in how people see and understand systems—as he puts it, in the “visual representation of dynamic behavior.”\n\n## Model-based design\nThe problem is code isn't the code itself, it's knowing WHAT to code.\n- \"Because most of the requirements are kind of natural language, ambiguous, and a requirement is never extremely precise, it’s often understood differently by the guy who’s supposed to code.”\"\n- \"On this view, software becomes unruly because the media for describing what software should do—conversations, prose descriptions, drawings on a sheet of paper—are too different from the media describing what software does do, namely, code itself.\"\n- Model-based design, which uses flowcharts to describe what the software is supposed to do, is supposed to close this gap.\n- i.e. ANSYS SCADE\n- \"Much of the benefit of the model-based approach comes from being able to add requirements on the fly while still ensuring that existing ones are met; with every change, the computer can verify that your program still works. You’re free to tweak your blueprint without fear of introducing new bugs. Your code is, in FAA parlance, “correct by construction.”\"\n\n## Testing/proving code is reliable\nChris Newcombe andTLA+\n- An algorithm written in TLA+ could in principle be proven correct. In practice, it allowed you to create a realistic model of your problem and test it not just thoroughly, but exhaustively. \n- \"That is, before you write any code, you write a concise outline of your program’s logic, along with the constraints you need it to satisfy (say, if you were programming an ATM, a constraint might be that you can never withdraw the same money twice from your checking account). TLA+ then exhaustively checks that your logic does, in fact, satisfy those constraints. If not, it will show you exactly how they could be violated.\"\n- Developed by Leslie Lamport\n\n\"For Lamport, a major reason today’s software is so full of bugs is that programmers jump straight into writing code. “Architects draw detailed plans before a brick is laid or a nail is hammered,” he wrote in an article. “But few programmers write even a rough sketch of what their programs will do before they start coding.” Programmers are drawn to the nitty-gritty of coding because code is what makes programs go; spending time on anything else can seem like a distraction. And there is a patient joy, a meditative kind of satisfaction, to be had from puzzling out the micro-mechanics of code. But code, Lamport argues, was never meant to be a medium for thought. “It really does constrain your ability to think when you’re thinking in terms of a programming language,” he says. Code makes you miss the forest for the trees: It draws your attention to the working of individual pieces, rather than to the bigger picture of how your program fits together, or what it’s supposed to do—and whether it actually does what you think.\" \n- DESIGN REVIEWS\n\n\"Lamport sees this failure to think mathematically about what they’re doing as the problem of modern software development in a nutshell: The stakes keep rising, but programmers aren’t stepping up—they haven’t developed the chops required to handle increasingly complex problems.\"","timeCreated":"2017-10-05T11:22:28+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-10-05T12:02:56+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59d6864ec128fe504ba880f2"},"text":"Tweet from Kamala Harris:\n\n\"A government has three functions: public health, public safety, and public education.

Imperative v Declarative\n- Imperative - the code describes the steps that need to happen\n- Declarative - the code describes what you want the end result of the code to be\n- React lets you write UI code in a declarative way\n- Declarative code is easier to understand and easier to compose with other code.\n\nExamples\n- \u003cTone\u003e component which wraps the imperative code required to control the web audio API.\n- Wrap code in a \u003cPinScrollToBottom\u003e component which handles the imperative implementation details of conditionally pinning the scroll position of its children when they update.\n\n2. Compound Components\n- Wrap components in a parent component which controls state and passes it to its children by cloning them and merging in props based on the parent component state.\n\nExamples\n- \u003cTabList\u003e and \u003cTab\u003e components. \u003cTabList\u003e holds the active tab state and passes that to each child \u003cTab\u003e to control how the \u003cTab\u003e is rendered.\n- \u003cRadioGroup\u003e component that controls active radio button state and renders \u003cRadioButton\u003e children\n\n3. Context\n- Allows you to pass data via React \"context\" from some parent component to any children without passing props to intermediate components.\n- Use with caution - passing data explicitly is almost always better.\n\nExamples\n- Same as Compound Components but more flexible because you are not tied to a specific component hierarchy.\n- \u003cAudioPlayer\u003e component that renders buttons and components that control playback.\n\n4. Higher order components\n- Pattern where a function sets up state/context/whatever and then returns a new component class.\n- The function usually accepts some component class and some arguments and returns a new component class that decorates and then renders the passed-in component class\n- Used when you need to pass data to a wrapped component at bootstrap-time.\n\nExamples\n- withStorage component that wraps some base component and injects localStorage getters/setters/subscription\n\n5. Render prop callbacks\n- Function prop that is passed to a component and then invoked in the component's render method.\n- A very composable abstraction\n- Used when you need to pass data to the wrapped component at render-time.\n\nExamples\n- \u003cGeoPosition\u003e component that get GPS coordinates from navigator.geolocation and then passes them to the component in the `render` prop.\n- \u003cGeoAddress\u003e component that gets an address from GPS coordinates then passes that to the component in the `render` prop\n- Render prop callbacks make these really composable.\n\n6. Implementing React Router\n- Uses compound component to maintain state at the \u003cRouter\u003e level and pass it to each \u003cRoute\u003e\n- Passes state to child components using context\n- Uses render prop callbacks to pass current route location data to the wrapped components\n\n7. Implementing Redux\n- Uses compound component to maintain state at the \u003cProvider\u003e level and pass it to each connect-ed component.\n- Passes state to child components using context\n- HoC to control what data is passed to wrapped components with the connect function. This function returns a new class that renders the wrapped component with new props. It gets an instance of the store through context.\n- mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProp arguments to connect allow caller to configure what data from the store gets passed in and what the prop names are that get passed to the component.\n\n8. Controlled Components\n- Sometimes component state can be entirely internal to a component. Nothing outside it needs to know about or control its state. This is an uncontrolled component.\n- Other times, you want to control component state from outside the component via props because other things need to know about the state or because some external input should control the state.\n- You can make a component do either (be \"controlled\" OR \"uncontrolled\") by implementing an isControlled() method that you can check to decide if you want to use internal state or external props.\n- Don't try to keep the state in sync with props! Just decide which to use.\n- In some cases, you may want to use internal state, but also notify the caller when the state changes in which case you an use internal state but call some kind of onChange prop, too.\n\nExamples\n- Form components\n- \u003cTabs\u003e compound component where sometimes the active tab state is entirely internal to the components and sometimes some external component wants to know which is the active tab or wants to control which is the active tab like with a \"Set to n tab\" button. In the former case, just use internal state to get and set activeIndex. In the latter case, pass in an activeIndex tab and an onChange callback prop.\n- Drop down component that has the same behavior as ^. You may want to use the same pattern for the selected value AND whether or not the drop down is open.","timeCreated":"2017-10-15T19:15:51+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-10-16T11:23:22+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"59e4184c7351c43121537006"},"text":"This weekend\n\nKatie and Emily's came to visit with Riley.

The problem with this model is that there’s an opaque dependency between what the page loading action needs to fetch/return and the actual data requirements of the component hierarchy. In other words, the data you need for any state of your app is defined by the data requirements of the components that are rendered. Since this dependency between the data fetching layer and the view layer isn’t explicit, it’s easy to over-fetch data that the view hierarchy doesn’t need or to under-fetch data by missing new requirements when the component hierarchy changes. Despite the “loose coupling” in our code, we actually often need to change one in conjunction with the other.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we could ditch the “page” concept altogether, and say that all components in an arbitrary component hierarchy are all responsible for fetching their own data requirements via componentDidMount. This could cause other problems, such as refetching data that’s already been fetched (possibly ameliorated by a smart data caching layer) or a confusing mental model where it’s hard to tell which components are fetching which data. This is extra complicated with a our REST-ish interface where we sometimes fetch data through other data, which makes it difficult to model data requirements at the individual component level. Plus, this would deeply couple not just the data requirements, but also the data fetching layer to view components, which may be a pain point if the data fetching code needs to change.\n\nIdeally we would be able to get the best of both worlds:\n\nCentralize the actual data fetching code, i.e. the HTTP layer that handles sending requests to a server and storing/caching the result.\nAllow components (or something closer to the components) to declaratively express their data requirements in a way that can be marshalled by the data fetching layer.\n\nTurns out that GraphQL is actually a great way to “declaratively express data requirements” and the single HTTP endpoint + UUID caching pattern allows for a clear mental model for how to marshall these data requirements up to a single HTTP layer.\n\nUltimately, this is a pretty different architecture than our current page-level data fetching paradigm, but it might be worth striving for. It presumes that we have a GraphQL server to query, so that would be a hard dependency to a full implementation.\n","timeCreated":"2017-10-25T05:42:15+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59fc6f017351c43121537009"},"text":"Ideas for this app:\n\nIntroduce post.status:\n- DRAFT\n- SAVED\n- ARCHIVED\n\nCreate in \"DRAFT\" status when you start typing so it syncs to all devices\n\nDebounce a call to save as you type\n\nAlso store copy of the currently editing post in localStorage so you can refresh the page\n- \u003cLocalStorageSync\u003e component or something\n\nSideways scroll?\n\nRich server-side search","timeCreated":"2017-11-03T13:28:33+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59ffcf057351c4312153700a"},"text":"This weekend\n\n- Friday - finished Stranger Things 2.

The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right.

They found that children who were good at math were more likely to be patent holders, but they also had to have high socio-economic status. Students with high test scores and low SES were \"no more likely to become inventors than below-average math students from affluent families.\" There were also gaps based on location (those from southeastern United States with high math scores were less likely to have a patent), race (African-Americans and Latinos with high math scores were less likely to have a patent) and sex (women with high math scores were less likely to have a patent).\n\n\"Our society appears to be missing out on most potential inventors from these groups. And these groups together make up most of the American population.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that kids who grew up around innovators were also more likely to be innovators themselves.\n\nThis is infuriating, especially under the assumption that these trends generalize to little \"c\" creativity and small scale innovative work other than just patents. America depends on inventions and inventive people and we're leaving behind valuable contributions. It's also a great economic view of the impact on the US SES gap. It's not just immoral, it's not economically sound. Paired with correlations on the other side - that kids left behind on the lower end of the academic scale cost money by ending up in jail - this might be the biggest economic challenge we face right now as a society.\n\nThis kind of connects to Karl's point about governments not being good at legislating long-term solutions to problems like this. From the abstract:\n\n\u003e The model implies that increasing exposure to innovation in childhood may have larger impacts on innovation than increasing the financial incentives to innovate, for instance by reducing tax rates.\n\ni.e. this is an education problem that's hard to solve.","timeCreated":"2017-12-07T00:50:04+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2017-12-07T01:24:22+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a28915f7351c43121537015"},"text":"3 Reasons why this tax overhaul is a bad idea:\n\n1. It will grow the federal deficit. No matter how hard the GOP wants to not believe this, every single independent economic impact study has come to the same conclusion: it will not grow the economy fast enough to offset the cost.\n\n2. It's effectively a stimulus package at a time when the economy is doing well and doesn't need an economic stimulus. Worse, in the event of an actual economic downturn or recession, it reduces the tools that the federal government has to deal with it.\n\n3. It disproportionately helps the rich more than the middle and lower classes and will add to the growing income disparity that is endemic right now. Fixing this (not worsening it) should be a core concern of the federal government.","timeCreated":"2017-12-07T00:54:55+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a3c4dee7351c43121537016"},"text":"Mike's speech\n\n- Mike never asked me to be the best man, so I wasn't sure if this was my deal until a few hours ago\n\n- for those who don't know me, my wife Nicole and I went to high school with Mike and college with Mel.

Can iterate through time proportional to number of entries and takes up space proportional to the number of entries.\n\nDFS - depth first search\n- Keeps track of vertices (index v), marked vertices (marked[boolean]) and the edge from which you got to the vertex (edgeTo)\n- Visit each node, mark it, note the index that got you there, then recursively do the same for each connected vertex\n- Marks all vertices connected to s in time proportional to the sum of their degrees\n- Can find vertices connected to s in constant time\n- Can find path to s in time proportional to its length\n- A stack data structure\n\nBFS\n- A queue data structure\n- For each vertex in the queue, pop vertex v off the queue, add all vertices that are adjacent to v to the queue, then \\\"mark\\\" them. \n- Keep track of edgeTo[] (how we got there) and distTo[] (how far from vertex v)\n- Solves the shortest path problem - find path from s to t that uses the fewest number of edges\n- runs in time proportional to E + V\n\nConnected Components\n- Algorithm to create an \\\"is connected to\\\" relation that can answer the question \\\"is s connected to v\\\" in constant time.\n- Reflexive, symmetric and transitive\n- For each vertex, create an identifier number where if two vertices have the same id, they are connected.\n- Use DFS to build the data structure. As you do the DFS, keep track of the unmarked node you start from to use as the id (the cc, or connected component number). Continue on with the next unmarked node and increment CC.\n- ex. spread of STDs, particle detection\n\nGraph Challenges\n\nIs the graph bipartite?\n- you can divide the vertices into two subsets such that every edge connects a vertex in one subset with a vertex in another. I.\n- I.e. Kevin Bacon graph, i.e. STD graph\n- Can use DFS to figure this out by labeling vertices in a certain way\n\nDoes the graph contain a cycle?\n- Cycle - a vertex that has edges back to itself\n- Can use DFS to solve this\n\nBridges of Konigsberg\n- Given a graph, is there a cycle that uses every edge exactly once?\n- If it's connected and every vertex has an even degree, then you can always do it\n\nCan you find a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once?\n- i.e. the traveling salesperson problem\n- Intractable problem, nobody knows an efficient solution to this\n\nGiven two graphs, are they identical except for how we named the vertex?\n- Represent the same connections\n- Find similar connection structures\n- No one knows how to solve this\n\nCan you lay out a graph on the plane without crossing edges?\n- Linear-time algorithm for this using DFS\n\nDirected Graphs\n- Set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges\n- Can use DFS to find paths through digraphs to determine reachability\n- ex: program control-flow analysis, mark-and-sweep garbage collector\n- Can also use BFS, too\n- ex: shortest path, web crawler\n\nTopological Sort\n- Given a set of tasks to be completed with precedence constraints, in which order should we schedule the tasks?\n- Redraw the DAG so all edges point upwards\n- Run DFS, when done with the vertex, but it in a stack, then reverse the stack for reverse postorder.\n- Used for cycle detection\n\nStrong Components\n- Vertices v and w are strongly connected if there is a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v\n- Divides the digraph up into sets called strongly connected components that have the property that there are directed paths connecting each pair of vertices in the set.\n- ex: ecological food webs, software modules\n- Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm\n\nMinimum Spanning Trees (MST)\n- Given an undirected graph G with weighted edges\n- A spanning tree of G is a subgraph T that is both a tree (connected and acyclic) and spanning (includes all vertices).\n- Goal: Find a min weight spanning tree\n- ex: Bicycle routes, models of nature, dithering\n\nKruskal's Algorithm\n- Sort the edges by weight\n- Add the next edge to the MST unless that edge creates a cycle\n- Continue when you have V - 1 edges\n\nPrim's Algorithm\n- Start with vertex 0 and greedily grow tree T\n- Add to T the min weight edge with exactly one endpoint in T (i.e. connect a tree vertex to a non-tree vertex)\n- Continue until you have V - 1 edges\n- Lazy and eager implementation. eager removes unnecessary edges in the queue\n\nUses of MST\n- Euclidean MST - connect points in a plane, edges are distances between points. Build a subgraph where close points are all connected, find MST\n- Clustering - find objects in k groups so that objects in different clusters are far apart, i.e. web page documents, starts, cholera outbreaks. Single-link clustering - distance between clusters is the distance between its two closest parts, find a k-clustering that maximizes the distance between the two closest clusters. Use kuskal's algorithm, stop when you have k clusters. Or use Prim's algorithm and get rid of largest edges until you are left with k clusters.\n\nShortest paths\n- Given edge-weighted digraph, find the shortest path from s to t\n- source-sink - from one vertex to another\n- single source - from one vertex to every other**\n- all pairs - between all pairs of verticies\n\nShortest paths - Edge relaxation\n- relax edge e = v -\u003e w\n- distTo[v] is length of shortest known path from s to v\n- distTo[w] is length of shortest known path from s to w\n- edgeTo[w] is last edge on shortest known path from s to w\n- if e = v -\u003e w gives shorter path to w through v, update both distTo[w] and edgeTo[w]\n\nShortest paths - Optimality conditions\n- Way to know we have the shortest path\n- Let G be an edge-weighted digraph. Then distTo[] are the shortest path distances from s iff:\n1. distTo[s] = 0\n2. For each vertex v, distTo[v] is the length of some path from s to v\n3. For each edge e = v-\u003ew, distTo[w] \u003c= distTo[v] + e.weight()\n\nShortest paths - Generic algorithm computes SPT (if it exists) from s\n- Initialize distTo[s] = 0 and distTo[v] = infinity for all other vertices\n- Repeat until optimality conditions are satisfied:\n  - Relax any edge\n\nDijkstra's Algorithm\n- Consider vertices in increasing order from s\n- Add vertex to tree and relax all edges pointing from that vertex\n- Basically the same as Prim's algorithm. In both cases, we are building a spanning tree of the graph. In Prim's algorithm, you take a vertex that's closes to the tree anywhere on the tree. In Dijkstra's algorithm, we take the next closes vertex to the source.z\n- Also works for Edge-weighted DAGs - consider all vertices in topological order, relax all edges pointing from that vertex.\n- e.x. smart image resizing\n- Longest path - negate all the weights and then find shortest path\n- e.x. parallel job scheduling problem\n\nNegative cycles\n- Makes shortest path problem harder. \n- Bellman-Ford algorithm - finds shortest path\n- Negative cycles makes the problem intractable\n- Finding negative cycle - Bellman-Ford gets stuck in loop. If a vertex is updated the last time through the algorithm, you have a negative cycle\n- e.x. arbitrage detection in exchange rates\n\nShortest path is a general problem solving model.\n\n------\n\nMincut\n- A st-cut is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets with s in one set A and t in other set B\n- Its capacity is the sum of the capacities of the edges from A to B\n- Mincut problem goal - find a cut of minimum capacity, i.e. how do we the graph with the minimal amount of work.\n- ex: US finding the cheapest way to cut rail lines off in the Soviet Union; same for information networks\n\nMaxflow\n- An st-flow is an assignment of values to the edges such that:\n1. Capacity constraint: 0 \u003c= edge's flow \u003c= edge's capacity (how much stuff can flow through the edge)\n2. Local equilibrium: inflow = outflow at every vertex (except s and t) (stuff coming in has to equal stuff going out)\n- Maxflow problem goal: Assign a value to the flow, how much stuff can you get to the target, or how much stuff can you push out of the source\n- ex: Soviet Union maximizing the flow of supplies to Eastern Europe; same for communication flows\n\nMincut and maxflow are the same problem. They are \"dual\" - solving one problem solves the other.\n\nFord-Fulkerson Algorithm\n- Start with 0 flow\n- Find an undirected path from s to t such that\n1. Can increase the flow on forward edges (not full). Augment flow if there's capacity at any edge.\n2. Can decrease flow on backward edge (not empty). Preserves local equilibrium\n- Terminates when can't find any more paths from s to t\n\nMaxflow uses\n- Bipartite matching - n jobs, n students apply for them. Can all students get matched to a job? Bipartite graph - two sets of vertices, each edge goes from one type to another. Add a source and target vertices and connect to each student and job with capacity 1, add infinite capacity edge from each student to job. Find maxflow to get the mapping. Mincut tells you if and why there is no perfect matching.\n- Baseball elimination problem - given n teams with wins/losses and games left, which are mathematically eliminated?\n\n---\n\nRadix Sorts\n- strings - sequences of characters\n- character -8-bit int,  7-bit ASCII, 16-bit unsigned int Unicode, etc.\n- Can we sort without compareTo which bounds sorting algorithms?\n\nKey-indexed Counting\n- Keys using to sort are small integers\n- Assumption: keys are integers between 0 and r-1\n- Implication: Can use key as an array index\n- algorithm to sort an array a[] of N integers (represented here as letters) between 0 and R - 1:\n1. Count frequencies of each letter using key as index. Add to count[r] array\n2. Compute frequency cumulates which specify destinations (add the previous frequencies to each frequency so that the indexes increment up). This tells you how to distribute the keys in the output.\n3. Access cumulates using key as index to move items into aux[i]. Increment the indexes in count[r] each time so subsequent instances of that index are put in the right place.\n4. Copy back into original array\n\nLeast-significant-digit-first (LSD) Radix Sort\n- Sort full strings by sorting by the right-most character. Loop through each subsequent character from right-to-left.\n- Can do key-indexed counting from right to left.\n- R (radix) is the size of the array needed for the counts and cumulates\n- Good for sorting with fixed-length keys, i.e. sort 1 million 32-bit integers\n\nMost-significant-digit-first (MSD) string sort\n1. Start with the first character and partition array into R pieces (use key-indexed counting)\n2. Recursively sort all strings that start with each character (key-indexed counts delineate subarrays to sort).\n- Slow for small subarrays\n- Lots of small subarrays due to recursion\n- Only examples just enough characters to sort the keys, so can be sublinear in some cases\n\n3-way radix quicksort\n1. Start with first character and divide into three sub-arrays - less than character, equal to character, greater than character\n2. recursively sort each sub-array by doing ^ through each character.\n- Uses less space than MSD string sort\n\nSuffix Arrays\n- Keyword-in-context search - given a text of N characters, preprocess it to enable fast substring search (find all occurrences of query string context)\n1. List all suffixes as a giant list of substrings\n2. Sort the list\n3. Use binary search to find occurrences of substring. Use the index to find the substring in the original string\n\n- Longest repeated substring problem - Given a string of N characters, find the longest repeated substring. ex scientific analysis, cracking cryptography, data compression, analyze repetitions in music.\n1. Use a suffix sort to bring the longest substrings together\n2. Go through and find the longest substring\n- Problem: if LRS is long\n\nManber-Myers MSD algorithm\n- linearithmic finding longest repeated substrings when the substrings are long\n\nR-way Tries\n- Store each characters in nodes\n- Each node has R children, one for each possible character. Use null links when there are no children for a given value.\n- Store values in notes corresponding to the last characters in the keys\n\nTernary Search Tries\n- Like a trie, but each node has three children: smaller (left), equal (middle), larger (right)\n- Fewer null links in TST than R-way Tries, more space efficient for large Rs\n\n----\n\nSubstring Search\n- Goal: Find pattern of length M in a text of length N\n- M might be small and N might be huge\n\n\nKnuth–Morris–Pratt\n- Use a DFA to keep track of how much of the search pattern you have matched.\n- Needs no memory about the input (i.e. no backup), so you can process an input stream.\n- How to build the dfa[][] table for the full text?\n1. Fill in the known transitions for the match transitions\n2. Find the longest prefix of the match pattern that is a suffix of the current string.. Keep track of where the state *would* be on each subsequent substring until you fill in the table. In addition to incrementing j as you see characters i, move x through and check each possible mismatch pattern.\n- Linear space/time proportional to RM\n\nBoyer-Moore\n- Scan characters in pattern from right to left\n- Can skip M chars when find a mismatch\n- Time proportional to n / m\n- Worst case is as bad as ~mn\n\nRabin- Karp\n- Compute a modular hash for characters 0 to M - 1\n- For each i, compute hash of text characters i to M + 1 - 1\n- If pattern hash == substring hash, check for a match\n\n----\n\nRegular Expressions\n- Pattern matching: find one of a specified set of strings in text\n- RegEx algorithms can use DFA, but too many combinations. Typically use NFA instead.\n- Keep track of all possible states the NFA can be in after reading i characters of input.\n- Can use DFS for this ^\n\n---\n\n(Lossless) Data Compression\n\nRun-length encoding\n- Bitstreams have long runs of repeated bits\n- Use counts to represent repeated bits\n- How many bits to store the counts? Usually 8. If longer than that, intersperse runs of length 0\n\nHuffman Encoding\n- Can handle variable-length codes, which can be ambiguous (i.e. Morse code)\n- How to avoid ambiguity? Fix-length code. Or ensure no codeword is a prefix of another. Or append special stop char to each word. Or prefix-free code.\n- Huffman encoding - find the code that uses the fewest bits for a message that creates a prefix-free code.\n- Can represent prefix-free code in a binary trie. Decode by just following the leaves from the root until you reach a terminal character in a leaf.\n- How to construct the trie?\n- How to find the best prefix-free code?\n\nLZW Compression\n- Compression:\n1. Create a codeword symbol table (ST) of strings with fixed-length integer values starting with single string values for the radix of the input language.\n2. Go through the input string, and represent each character with the value in the ST.\n3. Each time you record a character, look ahead +1 characters and record that character string in the ST.\n4. When you find that same w-bit character string, replace the whole thing with the corresponding key in the ST.\n5. Repeat and add an additional character string to the ST when you find a match.\n- Represent the ST as a trie - efficiently supports longest prefix match operations\n\n- Expansion:\n1. Go through list of fixed-length integer values and represent each as the value in the codeword ST. Start this in reverse by assuming the compression started with a ST of single values for the radix of the input language.\n2. Repeat ^ and build the same codeword table\n- Can store output in an array\n\n- Gotcha - when the last string matches a key in the symbol table that doesn't show up elsewhere\n\n-- \n\nLinear Programming - Simplex algorithm\n- i.e. Brewer's problem\n- Express problem as a system of inequalities and a basic feasible solution (BFS)\n1. Start at some extreme point\n2. Pivot from one extreme point to an adjacent one\n3. Repeat until optimal \n\n----\n\nIntractibility\n- Hardware and theories of computing are always bound by algorithm efficiency - you cannot solve large problems with exponential growth algorithms.\n- AKA a problem is intractable if it can't be solved in polynomial time.\n\nP vs NP\n- NP = the class of all search problems. The things we aspire to compute feasibly.\n- P = the class of search problems (subset of NP) solvable in polynomial time. The things we actually go compute feasibly.\n\n- N stands for nondeterminism. A nondeterministic machine can guess the desired solution.\n- NP = Search problems solvable in polynomial time on a nondeterministic Turing machine (a TM that has multiple states per node).\n- Extended Church-Turing theses: P = search problems solvable in polynomial time in the natural world.\n- NP-Complete - hardest problems in NP. Many problems reduce to this one.\n\n**Does P = NP?**\n- If yes, we can find poly-time algorithms for all problems we want to solve\n- If no, there's something fundamental about the universe w.r.t. nondeterminism.\n- Consensus is that P != NP\n\n- Cryptography exploits intractability\n\nI finished this with a big old grin as Robert Sedgewick perfectly wrapped up all the ideas of the course in the idea of P = NP along with the inscription on the side of the Princeton CS building and a song about intractability :)","timeCreated":"2018-02-27T01:25:54+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2018-04-01T03:27:04+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5a94b3ccbaa1e00035deeaae"},"text":"Handmaid's Tale\n\n# Authorship and audience\n- narrator breaks the fourth wall and refers to the reader.

Income inequality\n3. School quality\n4. Family structure\n5. Social capital\n\n# Policies to Increase Upward Mobility\n- Given above, policy focus should be on moving families to higher-opportunity areas\n\n# Policies to revive absolute mobility:\n\n1. Higher growth, OR\n2. More broadly shared growth\n\nIs increased social mobility desirable? Does it make the economy less efficient? What are the tradeoffs?\n- Question: how does increasing equality of opportunity\naffect aggregate growth?\n- Focus on innovation as driver of growth**\n\n- Differences in environment explain an innovation gap between white boys and non-white boys and all girls as determined by school performance and likelihood of getting a patent grant.\n- We are leaving behind these inventors, which hurts out growth. Policy should focus on bringing these people back into the innovation economy.\n\nPolicy implications:\n1. Tackle social mobility at a local, not just national level\n2. Improve childhood environment at all ages (not just\nearliest ages)\n3. Focus not just on schools and housing but on networks\nand social norms\n4. Use big data to measure local progress and performance\n\n## Education and Upward Mobility\n- Education is pathway to upward mobility.\n- Upward trend in more education ended in 1980\n- Does education still level the playing field?\n\n- Use \"mobility report cards\" to identify \"high-mobility rate\" higher ed institutions that accept high rates of students from low income distributions and bring them into high income distributions.\n- Do further research to figure out what makes them good at this and scale it\n\n- Also, elite colleges are uniquely good at getting people from the lowest income percentiles to the highest 1%\n- Should also help more kids do this.\n\n# Missing Applicants to Elite Colleges\n- The cost for low-income students of attending most competitive colleges is actually not as high as other colleges.\n- However, they are underrepresented in the applications\n- How to get more low-income students to apply to top-tier institutions?\n\n- More information in the form of mailings helps and is a low-cost, scalable solution\n\nK-12 Education\n- Main question: how can we maximize the effectiveness of this\nsystem to produce the best outcomes for students?\n- i.e. the education production function.\n- Use standardized tests to measure. They are predictive of future success (but don't explain all the variance)\n\n- How Can We Improve Poorly Performing Schools?\n- There is high variance in some schools, we can study those.\n\n- Spending money isn't necessarily the best way\n\n- Smaller class sizes appears to increase performance on standardized tests and later earnings.\n- Studied schools in Sweden that have a max class size of 25\n\n- Good teachers are also really impactful\n- Studied high value-added teachers entering school in grade x. Grade x scores went up, grade x - 1 scores stayed flat.\n- Inverse is true for low value-added teachers.\n- Same results are evident in college attendance rates and other long-term outcomes\n\n----\n\nLife Expectancy is correlated with affluence.\n- Difference across regions\n\nPredictive models for forecasting epidemics\n- Google search terms correlated with flu outbreaks. Worked at first, then broke down due to changes in the search functionality (autocomplete, etc)\n\nCaution with predictive models:\n- The model is not guaranteed to be stable over time\n- Prediction does not find causal mechanisms, just correlations, which aren't that stable. Models are not a substitute for ground truth.\n- Building good models requires technical skill and good judgement\n\nHealthcare Markets\n- They are weird.\n- Important: third-party payment - customer is not paying the price, no incentive to find the cheapest price or cut back on quantity.\n\nWhat is the causal effect of insurance on demand for health care and health outcomes? Is health care wasteful spending, or does it improve outcomes?\n- Increases health care utilization moderately\n- Improves self-reported health\n- Reducers financial hardship\n- No evidence of wasteful spending\n- Might be more impactful over time\n\nShould the government provide healthcare vs market?\n- Yes. \n1. Low-income people are sensitive to price - demand for health insurance falls rapidly as price rises.\n2. Healthiest low-income people more likely to buy - sicker people remain insured, increasing average cost for insurers, i.e. \"adverse selection\"\n\n\"Government intervention is critical to sustain markets for health insurance.\"\n\n\n----\nEnvironment\n\nNeed to quantify the economic impact of policy by pricing future cost.\n\n\"Reduction in air pollution increased children's earnings by about 1%\"\n- $6.5 billion per birth cohort\n\nSocial Cost of Carbon\n- Obama admin - $40 per ton of CO2 emitted\n- Trump admin - $5 per ton\n\nHow to prevent climate change?\n- Corrective taxes (i.e. gas tax) - Works a little, not that impactful\n- Incentives to purchase hybrid cars - works, but only if the incentives are structured correctly (up-front discount vs tax cut)\n- Tiered pricing, charge more for high-capacity electricity users - only works if price changes are clearly visible\n- Social feedback, i.e. comparing energy use with neighbors - impactful, low cost. May work differently in different markets\n\n-----\nDiscrimination and criminal justice\n\n- Black men earn about \u003c $0.80 per dollar of white worker. Stable since 1980s\n- Women ear about $0.80 per dollar of male worker. Increasing since 1980s\n\n^ Partially due to differences in economic opportunities (schools, environment, etc)\n- Also due to discrimination\n1. Job opportunity callback rates\n2. Airbnb host bookings\n\nTwo different kinds of discrimination\n1. Taste-based - preference for races unrelated to performance\n2. Statistical discrimination - use of race as signal for other aspects of background\n- Both are bad, but distinguishing between them important for understanding solution.\n\nOrchestra experiment shows evidence of #1\n\nJudge decisions to grant parole - decision fatigue, unconsciously use the wrong metrics on judging future crime.\n- Predictive analytics can be better at this with machine learning decision trees\n- Need to be careful with the ethics (although judges already kind of do this and they do it badly)","timeCreated":"2018-04-14T13:59:33+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"timeUpdated":"2018-05-06T14:57:00+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5adb5c0b51851d003592ca03"},"text":"Ideal FE data architecture:\n\nWrite components w/o any knowledge of data layer.\n\nAt certain points in the app, wrap ^ components in something that can express data requirements (probably in graphql)\n- Data wrapper injects its data fragment into the root data fetcher (reverse DI)\n- What is the heuristic for this?

He's fighting for \"equality\" of thought. He doesn't want to speak for the group anymore. He's also drawn to how Trump \"did the impossible,\" achieved something \"no one else could do.\" To him, black homogeneity of ideas is the same thing as the slave plantation. This is all 100% Kanye.\n\nWest - \"Make America Great Again\" had a negative perception / I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction / added empathy, care, love and affection\"\n- This implies it had none of those things before\n- Repurposing the phrase\n\n\"I was in the Sunken Place and I found a New Me.\" ...\"A lot of people agree with me, but their too afraid to speak up.\"\n- Again, there's some slave/fear imagery here. White supremacy is working against him to control what he can and cannot think.\n\n\n\n----\n\nCoates - West is trying to liberate himself from a collective, black \"we,\" but he is doing that be entering a white \"we\" that can _afford_ not to care about the consequences of their ideas.\n\n\"And this is why the gift of black music, of black art, is unlike any other in America, because it is not simply a matter of singular talent, or even of tradition, or lineage, but of something more grand and monstrous. When Jackson sang and danced, when West samples or rhymes, they are tapping into a power formed under all the killing, all the beatings, all the rape and plunder that made America. The gift can never wholly belong to a singular artist, free of expectation and scrutiny, because the gift is no more solely theirs than the suffering that produced it.\"\n\n\"What Kanye West seeks is what Michael Jackson sought—liberation from the dictates of that we. In his visit with West, the rapper T.I. was stunned to find that West, despite his endorsement of Trump, had never heard of the travel ban. “He don’t know the things that we know because he’s removed himself from society to a point where it don’t reach him,” T.I. said. West calls his struggle the right to be a “free thinker,” and he is, indeed, championing a kind of freedom—a white freedom, freedom without consequence, freedom without criticism, freedom to be proud and ignorant; freedom to profit off a people in one moment and abandon them in the next; a Stand Your Ground freedom, freedom without responsibility, without hard memory; a Monticello without slavery, a Confederate freedom, the freedom of John C. Calhoun, not the freedom of Harriet Tubman, which calls you to risk your own; not the freedom of Nat Turner, which calls you to give even more, but a conqueror’s freedom, freedom of the strong built on antipathy or indifference to the weak, the freedom of rape buttons, pussy grabbers, and fuck you anyway, bitch; freedom of oil and invisible wars, the freedom of suburbs drawn with red lines, the white freedom of Calabasas.\"\n\n\"In any case what will remain is this—West lending  his imprimatur, as well as his Twitter platform of some 28 million people, to the racist rhetoric of the conservative movement....These are not stray thoughts. They are the propaganda that justifies voter suppression, and feeds police brutality, and minimizes the murder of Heather Heyer. And Kanye West is now a mouthpiece for it.\"\n\n\"It is the young people among the despised classes of America who will pay a price for this...West, in his own way, will likely pay also for his thin definition of freedom, as opposed to one that experiences history, traditions, and struggle not as a burden, but as an anchor in a chaotic world.\"\n\n---\n\nIn the end, that Kanye presenting this as a debate with T.I. in the video on his website and \"Ye vs. The People\" and cuts off the beat for the people to talk is really important. Coates has a good point, but one he wouldn't have made had Kanye not released this track.","timeUpdated":"2018-05-08T13:12:00+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5af1a22303003c003504260a"},"timeCreated":"2018-05-08T13:12:03+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Paradoxes of free speech\n\nGiven that free speech is net valuable for society, a society with free speech has to reckon with:\n\n1.

Had lunch at Tony \u0026 Penny's with Mike, Matt Mondry and George. Helped out at Tyler's a bit after. Nicole and I went to The Steaming Tender for dinner, which was a neat location with ok food. We stopped by The Altruist again after.\n\nSunday - left around 11am and picked up Thom at his parent's house in Hamden, CT. Came home, drank some Tree Houses and caught up. Thom's time in Ithaca doesn't sound too great, but he's doing ok.\n\nMonday - Had Dan \u0026 Soph over to drink some Tree Houses with us and Thom\n\nTuesday - Went to the Frank Tuner show with Nicole and Thom. Show was pretty good - I liked his music live more than recorded. \"Have fun but don't fuck up everyone having fun around you.\" - Frank Turner.\n\nWednesday - Thom went back to NY via train. Went to React meetup at Guru offices after work. Saw Jon, a former student of mine, and Ryan, another mentee, who both realized they knew me separately. Meetup was ok otherwise.\n\nThursday - Vinay organized happy hour with Yellow Dig. We started at our WeWork office, then went to the other WeWork office roof top. It was too crowded, so we moved to the Opa beer garden. It was fun talking to Brian about GraphQL, SPAs, Clojure and Datomic.","timeUpdated":"2018-06-08T21:43:24+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b1f27a94e67f9003517a3ee"},"timeCreated":"2018-06-12T01:53:45+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"The Rise of the Computer State\n\nInformation can and will be abused by governments and corporations, either on purpose (like surveillance) or by incompetence (like mistakes of identity).\n\nComputers make this worse by collecting more data and making it easier to parse.\n\nCentralization of information is an \"enlarged snooping hazard\"\n\nAre the costs worth the value?\n\n","timeUpdated":"2018-06-12T02:35:29+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b1fdff281afe80038f165ba"},"timeCreated":"2018-06-12T15:00:02+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"TODO: Story about hanging out with Matt \u0026 Kim","timeUpdated":"2018-06-12T15:00:22+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b219dc22c118d78c3981219"},"timeCreated":"2018-06-13T22:42:10+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Went to Friday Saturday Sunday for Nicole's birthday dinner last night.\n\nTop Philly meal.

What do you dread updating?\nWhich are your favorite to work on?\nWhich are “simple”?\nIs it “simple” or is it “easy”?\nWhich are “complex”?\nis it “complex” or is it “hard”?\nIs this complexity a side-effect of the application architecture (i.e. accidental/incidental complexity?) or is it inherent to our business logic (i.e. essential/problem complexity)?\nWhat the codebase missing?\n\n\n----\n\n\nI think we may have added some incidental complexity as a result of one major architectural decision: only `connect`ing *Page components to the global store at the top of the view hierarchy instead of `connect`ing anywhere. My gut is that there are downstream architectural constraints (not necessarily good ones) that are a result of this one that caused some unnecessary complexity.\n\nThere were two main reasons for this decision:\n1. An old bug in react-redux that caused issues `connect`ing components n levels deep in the component hierarchy\n2. Inability to come to a consensus about the heuristics for when to connect a component and for what kind of state belongs in the global store.\n\nAs far as I know, #1 has been resolved and we may now have more insight into #2.\n\nOther than these two reasons, there is some valuable benefits to this model:\n1. Simple mental model - where does this data come from? The immediate parent\n2. We avoid interleaving the global state management infrastructure in with the rest of our view code. Having _one_ place where the global store is tied to the view hierarchy may be easier to manage.\n3. Testing - most tests don't need to be concerned with setting of the context necessary to test something that's connected to the global store.\n\nThere are also some downsides:\n1. Connecting things to the store is hard because it may involve lots of intermediary components. As a result, we often don't put data in the store that probably should be there.\n2. Passing props through intermediary components creates unnecessary data dependencies - if component z needs prop a and z is rendered inside y which is inside x, then components  x and y need to know about data a JUST to pass it to component z.\n\nI _think_ it's possible to have a \"connect anywhere\" approach that keeps the mental model simple, hides implementation details of the global store from component code, and that's simple to test from an implenentation perspective. Some other benefits to a \"connect anywhere\" approach:\n1. Easier refactors - if components rely less on their parents and children, moving code around should be easier\n2. Easier code re-use - if components can get their own data and dispatch their own actions, it should be easier to drop whole systems into other systems (i.e. the file upload process)\n3. Simpler mental model for global state - we can use the global store to pass in _all_ global state, i.e. feature flags, i18n configuration, etc.\n\nHowever, I think it may introduce a bit more design complexity (or a least some new questions to consider):\n1. What are the heuristics for which components get `connect`ed and where?\n2. What state belongs in the global store and what belongs in local component state? Is there a place at all for component state anymore? When does the boilerplate/removability of code become a problem (or is this solvable)?\n3. Related to ^ - is it more complex to think about a piece of code as requiring a bunch of other pieces to work vs being a self-contained little functional piece of working code?\n\nA good connect anywhere approach should:\n1. Have clear heuristics for how to decide when a component gets `connect`ed and what state goes in the global store vs local component state\n2. Keep global store implementation details separate from component code\n3. Keep data flow visible\n4. Be testable\n5. (less important) Reduce boilerplate (but not over abstract) and maintain code \"removability\"\n\n---\n\nI also think our component code often does too much and has too much knowledge about our domain logic.\n\nI think this is because we are missing infrastructure for domain logic code that doesn't belong inside entity classes nor are simple utilities. I think creating an abstraction for this code would encourage us to write more testable and more reusable code.\n\nNOTE: It's possible that this is related to global state management \u0026 a `connect` anywhere approach - you could make an argument that _all_ business logic belongs in the global store. I'm not sure if this is reasonable or desirable, but maybe.\n\n----\nStyles... ugh, styles.\n\nIn general, I think we've done a good job encapsulating component styles with our namespacing convention. However, this is prone to human error and allows us to do some not so great things like reach into styles for component B in the stylesheet for component A. This creates an opaque dependency between the two that's hard to reason about and refactor.\n\nIt's pretty easy to automatically scope CSS classes to components with opaque identifiers that are impossible to abuse with css modules and webpack.\n\nHowever, there are places where calling code needs to re-jigger component styles, so we'd need to figure out an API for this. My gut is that this is usually a matter of spacing and sizing, which we could probably achieve some other way.\n\nComponents also implicitly depend on some global styles. Theming might be a better solution for this.\n\nWe might be able to follow InstUI's lead on both of these.\n\n\n----\n\nGlobal state management - the actions, interceptors, reducers and selectors.\n\nOverall, in the scope of the entire application, I think this is an implementation detail. In other words, we can (or should) be able to swap out our entire global state management process without *any* changes to the consuming component code.\n\nThat said, it's worth considering some architectural descisions *within* this component of the application.\n\nDispatching actions - we made a decision to skip \"action creators\" so that calling code only ever dispatches actions directly. This also led us to consistently think of actions as data (i.e. objects) and never behavior (i.e. functions). I think this was a good decision that keeps the mental model and calling code simple, but had some downstream implications. I.e., inability to use thinks, difficulty sequencing actions at the caller (which might be a good thing?), etc.\n\nIsolating side-effects - actions inevitably need to cause side-effects and redux doesn't come with a way to do that out-of-the-box. Because of our action dispatch constraint mentioned above, we moved this into the responsibility of \"interceptors\" identified by an action whitelist.\n\nI think this is _almost_ a good design. It's possible that we'd be able to flip around the side-effect registration process so that an action can kick off multiple side-effects (i.e. a one-to-many relationship between actions and interceptors instead of a one-to-one relationship), but that also might introduce some additional complexity. Might be worth looking into something like redux-observable.\n\nWe also do a lot of normalization logic inside interceptors. It'd probably be better to move that stuff to reducers. That way, we isolate the side-effects to interceptors and move all pure data processing logic to reducers. This might make things more testable.\n\nReducers - We've also started moving towards a one-to-many relationship between actions and reducers. I think this is a good thing that we should consider using more.\n\nSelectors - I think we're doing the right thing, here. The purpose of selectors is to give the caller a way to read data from the store without having knowledge about implementation details of the store.\n\nOverall, I think we can get some ideas on global state management architecture from re-frame.","timeUpdated":"2018-08-21T23:16:07+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b3660ff2c118d78c398121d"},"timeCreated":"2018-06-29T16:40:31+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Design, Composition, and Performance - Rich Hickey\n\n44:27+: “Constraint is the driver of creativity” \n- “embrace the constraints”\n- “Design is about making decisions”\n- “Leaving all options open is avoiding design”\n\n\n- \"Design is taking things apart in order to be able to put them back together.\"\n- \"Design like Bartok\"\n- \"Code like Coltrane\"\n- \"Langs and libs are like instruments\"\n- \"Pursue harmony\" in your designs - what makes things work together and apply that","timeUpdated":"2018-07-03T16:39:51+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b384f7e2c118d78c398121e"},"timeCreated":"2018-07-01T03:50:22+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Updated learning plan\n\n- Java/kotlin\n- clojure\n- styled components\n- react globtal application state patterns\n- Android dev","timeUpdated":"2018-07-01T03:51:56+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b3f5e18aa49fe68427d2d02"},"timeCreated":"2018-07-06T12:18:32+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"July 3rd\nWe went to Laura and Jeff's house.

Got 2 mostly full allotments from Tree House. Continued on the Maine and got to New Gloucester around 8pm. Met some of Mel's family and had dinner including lumpia that Mel's mom made. Hung out in the barn with Mike, Mel, Crysty, Luke, Ashley Andrew, Cyndi and others for a while. Mike ripped his shorts off and tried to put them back on.\n\nFriday - more barn setup. Nate arrived from the airport. Set up lawn games. Nate and Andrew and I invented Mr. oPen from the corn hole bean bag box. Did the rehearsal. Snuck the picture from the cruise into the picture table. Lots of other guests arrived for the welcome party after the rehearsal dinner. I talked to Ray and Chris Moorehouse for a while about Star Wars and the war on drugs and incarceration issues.\n\nSaturday - Set up more lawn games. Mike was real stressed, made him lay down. Practiced tying bow ties at the second house. I got Mike out around noon and brought him to the other house to get ready. Steamed his shirt and helped him tie his bow tie. Made him comb his hair. Sent him off for first look and pictures. Waited around for a while until ceremony time. I helped people cross the street from the parking lot. Walked in with to the wedding with Mel's mom. Cyndi officiated. Cocktail hour after. I signed their papers as their witness with Mel's sister, Bea. Welcomed them into the cocktail hour before we went into the barn. Mike and Mel did first dance outside the barn. George Burtch gave opening toast and talked up my \"best best man speech in the history of best man speeches.\" Bea gave a toast, then me. I delivered. At pizza and salad and then danced all night. Cake and ice cream for desert. Hung out a while after and helped clean up.\n\nSunday - Mike woke me up at 7:30 for help cleaning up. We worked on it with others until around 10am when others showed up for a farewell breakfast. We continued helping to clean up while people slowly left until it was just Mike, Mel, Nicole Nate and I. We agreed to take Nate to the airport, so he came with us into town to meet Mom, John, Fern and Erik for lunch and the catch the end of the World Cup finals match.

Trips there always make me notice my American-ness more, and I'm constantly comparing that against the Portuguese national identity.\n\nThe Trump era had me thinking a lot about the relationship between a national/cultural identity and the current reigning government leadership.\n\nThe Portuguese national identity runs deep. They were proud of their vast empire and having lost it gives them a shared sense of saudades. They share a love for their fruit, sardines, wine, rivers, beaches and the ocean. Hints of revolt against the Catholic Church poke through the surface, but even that seems like mostly a private endeavor. Very little of the Portuguese national identity seems to be tied to the young democratic republic created in 1974. Instead, it's nearly two thousand years of a shared cultural history, too old and too settled on to be challenged by dissidents, that has weaved between families and the cities they live in. The Portuguese are comfortable feeling Portuguese and generally know (or feel) what that means.\n\nAmerica, on the other hand, is defined by its very lack of a shared cultural history. The nation itself is too new and too much a composition of other people -- some brought here entirely against their will -- to have settled on cultural shortcuts to make us all feel connected. Anything older than the European colonists was raped and pillaged away with the Native Americans. Unlike the Portuguese, our national history is too raw to have scabbed over into a story we all agree on.\n\nComplicating this more, the closest we come to a shared national story are the Founding Fathers creating our Democratic Republic. As a result, unlike the Portuguese who have all sorts of things on which to hang their cultural heritage _other than_ their government, American's entire \"shared heritage\" *is* our government. This must be why we feel like we have so much skin in the game w.r.t. what politicians are in power. Since our shared American identity is so tied up with our democracy and our democracy is made up of representatives deputized to act on our behalf, then what our shared American identity is referring to is a function of the behavior and policies of the men and women in office which are imperfect and ephemeral. As a result, American's are uncomfortable feeling American nor do we agree on what that means.\n\nI think this explains why American nationalism feels taboo right now - in this moment, it's a tacit approval of the Trump administration which \u003e half the country actively despises, as it was of the Obama administration just a few years ago which marginalized the people who did not like him.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good thing or not. It seems like a good idea if its working as expected (i.e. we elect leaders who are good people who embody what we want American to represent), but inherently excludes a large portion of the population with each administration. If nothing else, it's quite dizzying.","timeUpdated":"2018-08-06T10:34:45+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7436e9aa49fe68427d2d05"},"timeCreated":"2018-08-15T14:21:29+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"FE React Architecture Question\n\nGiven a \"Connector\" pattern, who is responsible for providing the Connector?\n\nExample: form that may be displayed in a list of multiple forms where the form should show for the selected thing vs. showing the a form on a single entity page?","timeUpdated":"2018-08-15T14:22:54+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7631b7aa49fe68427d2d06"},"timeCreated":"2018-08-17T02:23:51+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"American Gods\n\n\"Religions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world.\" P 508","timeUpdated":"2018-08-17T02:24:56+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7ff38aaa49fe68427d2d07"},"timeCreated":"2018-08-24T12:01:14+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Promotion\n\nI was promoted to the Practice Team Lead this week, should be announced today.

Not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a thing and needs to be accounted for ahead of time.\n- It's not necessarily a good way to build a product. Building one-offs for clients without proper validation runs the risk of adding unnecessary features used by few or zero clients.\n- It's highly likely that the inflexible deadlines lead to cutting corners on the engineering side leading to insurmountable technical debt for a product we intend to grow and maintain.\n- It's not scalable. SOWs may pile up and cannot be parallelized. If deals consistently rely on this, engineering will become a sales bottleneck.\n\nUnderlying all of this is a feeling that, as a company, we've already been here with Bridge, are paying the price and haven't learned our lesson.","timeUpdated":"2018-09-04T22:51:54+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5b9a4fbfaa49fe68427d2d0b"},"timeCreated":"2018-09-13T11:53:35+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Last weekend\n\nJury duty on Wednesday put me on a civil trial until Friday afternoon.

I've been thinking about it a lot.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what it was really about, the underlying story. A few ideas:\n\n- Lying: this is a big part of the show and Don Draper's character. Ad men in general, too, are always lying. Lying is portrayed as a very masculine thing. In the last season, Sally Draper catches Don in multiple lies (cheating with the neighbor, being fired, etc) and it's portrayed as part of her growing up. In the end, she wants to grow up into someone different than her parents (Don: \"You are a very pretty girl, but it's up to you to be more than that.\").\n\n- On the flip side of ^, being true to who you are. I think this is what the ending sequence is about - all who can't keep relationships because they are married to their work keep working. Joan breaks up with that man to start her knew company. Peggy, who is more than her work, declines the partnership with Joan to be with Stan. Roger ends up with Meghan's mom despite what people might think. Don presumably returns to advertising and abuses his retreat experience. Pete drops the macho man façade and gets back together with his wife but stays a rich executive. All the rest of the show was people resisting or figuring out who they would become in this ending montage.\n\n- ^ is interesting w.r.t. Don. Usually, you like to see a story arc with characters who change from the beginning to the end. Don vacillates and kind of ends up where he started despite you thinking that he's had an epiphany.","timeUpdated":"2018-11-07T01:52:45+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5bd9abd72c118d78c3981228"},"timeCreated":"2018-10-31T13:19:19+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Unresolved questions about executing on SOWs\n\n*Questions of time* - setting ourselves up for success on timely delivery\n- Where did the deadline come from?

That designation means that it is **an implementation detail that is never revealed to the outside world** - nothing except the code it is a member of even knows it exists. As a corollary, any external collaborating code may _only_ interact with other code through its public API. This public/private designation guarantees two things about private code:\n\n1. its interface can change at any time and no code outside the class will ever break as long as any related public interface is unchanged, and\n2. We can change or remove the private method without breaking the public interface.\n\nIn a way, we can think of tests as basically just \"external collaborating code,\" which should only interact with the public interface of the code under test. The way I map this mental model to React components is that their public API is:\n\n1. Passing in props\n2. User interactions (clicks, changes, etc)\n3. The output of the `render` method\n\nand tests should strive to only use these to test behavior. In practice, violating this constraint means that you end up with brittle tests that may break when the API is working fine (because you re-named the private method, for example) and may pass when the public API is actually broken (because your tests fudges it).\n\nOn the other hand, pulling code like this out into a separate module/class/function/whatever is just a way to designate that code as \"public,\" or code that _may_ interact with any other collaborating code. This has the inverse set of guarantees as above:\n\n1. Changing its interface _may_ break other code, so it should be well documented and tested.\n2. Removing that code is effectively breaking a public interface, so we need to be a little more careful.\n\nIn this case, the \"other code\" might just be a test file, which is ok.\n\nAt the end of the day, pulling it out into something else that's clearly public is pretty close to what you have here. It can even be the exact same code, just in a different module with its own tests instead of in the component class and inside the component test.\n\nThat said, let's keep this here and see if it ever becomes an issue. If not, great! I was wrong. If so, no biggie, we'll refactor it.\n\nOn a meta level, though, I'm starting to realize that thinking critically about abstractions and how different parts of the codebase work together like this is 🗝 to good software engineering. Painful unit test setup is often an early code smell to help identify these sorts of decision points.\n\n@ypt might have more insight, he's better at explaining things like this :)","timeUpdated":"2018-11-07T22:35:14+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5be6f47caa49fe68427d2d13"},"timeCreated":"2018-11-10T15:08:44+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Learning stuff\n\nThemes\n- Foundational software design - SICP\n- Software management - The Manager's Path\n- Typescript and typing in general\n- Clojure + clojure.spec\n- stretch goal - Kubernetes + microservice architecture?\n\nProjects\n- Continue refactoring note taking app client with styled components, redux-frame, etc\n- Continue refactoring note taking app server with typescript\n- Re-write writermortis server with clojure + pedestal + graphql\n- Re-write writermortis client with Apollo GrpahQL client (mobile?)","timeUpdated":"2018-11-10T15:13:52+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5be88221aa49fe68427d2d15"},"timeCreated":"2018-11-11T19:25:21+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Evolutionary Architecture\n\n- All different architectures\n- One constant is that change is inevitable and you can't know how up front.

The opposite, a feeling of deep engagement in one’s work, came from a sense of energy, personal involvement, and efficacy. She and her colleagues developed a twenty-two-question survey known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which, for nearly four decades, has been used to track the well-being of workers across a vast range of occupations, from prison guards to teachers.\"\n- \"one of the strongest predictors of burnout was how much time an individual spent tied up doing computer documentation.\"\n\n\"Indeed, the computer, by virtue of its brittle nature, seems to require that it come first. Brittleness is the inability of a system to cope with surprises, and, as we apply computers to situations that are ever more interconnected and layered, our systems are confounded by ever more surprises. By contrast, the systems theorist David Woods notes, human beings are designed to handle surprises. We’re resilient; we evolved to handle the shifting variety of a world where events routinely fall outside the boundaries of expectation. As a result, it’s the people inside organizations, not the machines, who must improvise in the face of unanticipated events.\"\n\n\"Medicine is a complex adaptive system: it is made up of many interconnected, multilayered parts, and it is meant to evolve with time and changing conditions. Software is not. It is complex, but it does not adapt. That is the heart of the problem for its users, us humans.\"\n\n\"Adaptation requires two things: mutation and selection. Mutation produces variety and deviation; selection kills off the least functional mutations. Our old, craft-based, pre-computer system of professional practice—in medicine and in other fields—was all mutation and no selection. There was plenty of room for individuals to do things differently from the norm; everyone could be an innovator. But there was no real mechanism for weeding out bad ideas or practices.\n\nComputerization, by contrast, is all selection and no mutation. Leaders install a monolith, and the smallest changes require a committee decision, plus weeks of testing and debugging to make sure that fixing the daylight-saving-time problem, say, doesn’t wreck some other, distant part of the system.\"\n\n\"What we want and don’t have, however, is a system that accommodates both mutation and selection.\"\n\n\"As patients, we want the caring and the ingenuity of clinicians to be augmented by systems, not defeated by them.\"\n\n\"The story of modern medicine is the story of our human struggle with complexity. Technology will, without question, continually increase our ability to make diagnoses, to peer more deeply inside the body and the brain, to offer more treatments. It will help us document it all—but not necessarily to make sense of it all. Technology inevitably produces more noise and new uncertainties.\"\n\n\"But our systems are forever generating alerts about possible connections—to the point of signal fatigue. \"","timeUpdated":"2018-12-01T15:21:18+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c04114cbb7a7d0032a0e906"},"timeCreated":"2018-12-02T17:07:24+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Designing Events-First Microservices (QCon 2018)\n\nThinking in events forces you to think about the verbs before the nouns\n- \"Even-driven design\"\n\n- Event storming - get all stakeholders together to try to understand what's going on\n\nEven-driven design\n- Identify intents (represented as events) - communication, expectations, contracts\n- Look for facts - state, history, causality\n\n\nCommand - imperative, order to do something i.e. intent\nEvents - past tense, represents something has happened\n\nPublish immutable facts to the outside world\n- Contain mutable state to the service\n\nStart with eventual consistency and then opt in to strong consistency (i.e. CRUD) instead of the other way around.\n\nA system of microservices is a never-ending stream toward convergence.

It wasn't causing a bug, but it was not doing anything. Removing it made the type checker happy and removed some dead code.\n\n2. Then I migrated a TokenUtils function to typescript. I had to refactor the code a bit to remove a place where I was chaining a [] call after a regex match which isn't guaranteed to be an array. This made the type checker happy but I made a mistake that broke the code. I fixed the bug and added a unit test.\n\nBased on this experience, here's my thought on types: they allow you to annotate your code so that you (or some automated tooling) can know more about your code, including autocompletion, documentation, determining if certain code works with other code, etc. This adds value and minimizes a certain class or errors, but it does not actually tell you all that much about the _correctness_ of your code. For that, you still need to leverage the test pyramid, etc.\n\nAnyone telling you that \"if it compiles, the code works\" is over-selling types.\n\nAlso, this makes me more interested in clojure spec, which has the advantages of type annotations, but goes further in expressing \"correctness.\"","timeUpdated":"2018-12-31T14:11:08+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c323320a7fe7b003954ccd8"},"timeCreated":"2019-01-06T16:56:00+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Last few weeks\n\n...have been a little crazy.\n\nThe holiday's were great.

Sunday I brought Jim and Eric to the Patriots bar (Smith's) and they ended up cheering for the Eagles after which Jim got a kick out of. Then we met the others at Winterfest for Soph's birthday.

It's substantially different from the current application architecture, so we think it's more productive to do it green field rather than square peg/round hole-ing it into the current stack.\n\nInternal stakeholders seem generally open to this. Many are struggling with the timeline and what it means for the business. After much debate, our current plan forwards is to shore up the current integration to allow sales to meet their goals this year and start on a new build in Q3 ish. This seems reasonable to me.\n\nWe're also being asked to support ATI which would be a disaster. Again, after much debate and confusion, it sounds like we'll need to keep them on ApprenNet for a while longer and kick the can down the road until next year. This creates a significant amount of risk for engineering since that legacy app is a ticking time bomb. Hopefully, we can hand that off to a different team.\n\nThese plans make me feel a little better, but I've been bumming about work lately. It seems like there's a significant amount of misalignment and general confusion about our strategic vision for Practice specifically or Bridge as a whole. The lack of resources, new CEO and opening of the Budapest office is compounding the issue and putting everyone on edge. On the Practice team, we've been asked to work on a lot of things in a reactive way and are putting out a lot of fires. Doing this without a strategic plan makes it really hard to prioritize and understand why we are doing what we are doing.\n\nIn hindsight, I think waited to long to integrate our products and teams after the acquisition. It's no one's fault - the way the deal was structured incentivized Practice to be its own business unit and try to hit sales goals to trigger the earn out. Turns out those sales goals were impractical (due to overselling the value on both sides of the deal) and we have been slow to pivot after that became clear. I think if we were to do it again, we should have designated a small team last year to work on a proper integration alongside the standalone work/team and came up with a proper vision for integration much sooner. I think we're on the right path for this work now, but it feels too late. Moves are also being made to integrate other teams within Practice into the larger Bridge team (sales, CS), which I think is the right plan. End of Q2/beginning of Q3 will be a key time for us and I'll be expecting more clarity on everything around then.\n\nIn addition to all this, I just have a lot on my mind/plate right now:\n\n- building the team and keeping squad health metrics high\n- dealing with tech debt\n- backfilling tests (and my doubt that this is achievable worth it)\n- struggling to work better with Product, especially with a Product leadership gap due to Dana being pulled onto Bridge\n- learning how to be a manager\n- managing my own work/life balance","timeUpdated":"2019-01-06T17:29:06+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c323fdffc7a3e0038bdb41f"},"timeCreated":"2019-01-06T17:50:23+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"My thoughts on software going into 2019\n\n== Cautiously optimistic about TypeScript and types in general.\nMy first foray into TypeScript confirmed my thoughts after reading a lot about types: they are human and machine-readable metadata written around your code that allows systems to know more about your source. This enables some neat things, like automated compatibility checking, autocomplete, documentation, more attention to interfaces, etc. But they do NOT tell you the full picture about the correctness of your code. In the end, you still need to leverage your test pyramid in the same way to be sure that things are working as expected.\n\nIn my opinion, TypeScript is easy enough to use and the benefits are valuable enough that the cost of the overhead justifies the value, but beware of people who oversell types as achieving \"if it compiles, it's correct.\"\n\nW.r.t. program correctness, Clojure's ongoing approach with spec is something I want to watch closely.\n\n== Testing React components at scale is not fun and maybe isn't necessary.\nIdeally, testing should always be in service of helping developers write the code. The fact that devs and capture their tests in code and leave them there for verification of correctness and isolation later is a side-effect. If, instead, you constantly have to backfill tests after the fact, tests always feel like a slog and they will slowly end up not getting written or get written in a way that games the code coverage metrics but doesn't add any real value to your test suite.\n\nFor code that deals with testing function inputs and outputs, this is simple (especially when the functions are pure) and there is a lot of tooling to TDD this kind of stuff.\n\nHowever, I have not been able to reconcile this with any of the tooling available for testing UI written with React components. The tooling is just too crude, and value is too dubious and there is too much interaction with the outside world (i.e. browsers) that are not captured in these tests that I do not think the value prop outweighs the pain points.\n\nThis (as well as reading up on the philosophy behind re-frame, the ClojureScript UI framework) has brought me to a whole architectural philosophy w.r.t. front-end applications: all business logic and state (and combinations of the two) should live outside the UI code and there should be a clearly defined boundary between the two. Ideally, this allows you to keep all your business logic and state transformations in (ideally pure) functions that are easily testable. Your view code is a pure function of this data and, ideally, are so simple and dumb that they are not a likely source of bugs and therefore you don't feel the need to unit test them.\n\nIn practice, this could look a lot of different ways. I've been experimenting with using Redux as the state management store and react-redux as the boundary between the two. This lets you put all state in the store and use selectors and HoCs to build of \"materialized views\" of your store by way of pure functions that know about your state and business logic. The result are view models that get sent to your React components via props. Your view is a function of those simple view models. This isn't the only way to do it.\n\nIn lieu of component unit tests, I would recommend leveraging browser-driven testing tools like Cypress that exercise your UI code all wired up running in a browser in a way that is also optimized for a good developer experience. You may be able to replace your entire dev setup with the Cypress runtime and get the tests as a side-effect while devs TDD their UIs. Once Cypress has cross-browser support, you can use this suite to handle all end-to-end and visual regression testing, and all developers will be on board supporting the entire pipeline.\n\n== The only invariant you can rely on is change and systems should be architected with this in mind.\nChange in terms of technology AND business requirements. This is the main idea behind ThoughtWorks' \"evolutionary architecture.\" This has led me to abandon my search for the \"perfect\" language or framework because I no longer think that exists and, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you've optimized your system to handle these things changing. What does this look like? Microservices are part of it, but, again, less important than people make it seem. I think the most important things are design decisions that allow you to handle change and minimize the cost of releasing many generations of your software:\n\n- A solid CI/CD pipeline\n- Containerized platform for production infrastructure, i.e. Kubernetes\n- API gateway to centralizer auth and hide implementation details from consuming clients\n- Agreed on patterns and interfaces for inter-service communication.\n\nIf I were to start a project green field tomorrow, these are the things I would start with, perhaps even before making a language/framework choice.\n\n== Scaling teams is hard because, among other things, the \"coherence penalty.\"\nThe basic idea, here, is that there's a \"reconciling a world\" cost to on teams that gets more costly based on the size of the team. I think this is true within engineering teams, but also across disciplines as each become more silo's and farther away from the business and end users.\n\nI think there are some strategies to minimize this on the tech side (unproven):\n- Automate as much world reconciling as you can. This includes test coverage, linters, CI/CD pipelines, etc.\n- What you can't (or are yet to) automate, clearly document in an easy-to-find place.\n- Identify bounded contexts and have teams own them, either as separate microservices or parts of the application. (Be careful with this one, though -- identifying incorrect boundaries or getting too loosely coupled can have adverse consequences).\n\nOn the business/team side:\n- Have a clear strategic vision that everyone can point to.\n- Grow a team that can make decisions against ^ without being told why or how.\n- Have clear goals and report on them regularly.\n- Have a philosophy around prioritization and a process for how and why priorities change.\n\n","timeUpdated":"2019-01-06T21:04:32+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c3ea3fb6455bd0039deee61"},"timeCreated":"2019-01-16T03:24:43+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"What is my management philosophy?\n\n- confronting underperformers\nConfront it early.

There was a housing crises and couldn't look to Europe for borrowing anymore. The Fed kept interest rates low to incentivize spending. This made debt really cheap. Meanwhile, we invented the American consumer and started monetizing inventions of the 1930s. Debt began to rise but so did wages across all income bands. The culture became very homogenous - everyone watched the same TV, lived in similar houses, drove the same cars. Importantly, this was true across classes - those in the middle 50% lived a fairly similar life as in the 95%, as did the bottom 25% to the 50%.\n\nThings got weird at the end of the 1960s, as the Vietnam War and the 1968 race riots began to show cracks in the system. There was a recession in 1973. Economists argue about why (although, a stance on this via root cause analysis is important, I think), but as the economy and debt kept rising, money went into very different pockets - the rich got more rich and the middle class stayed about the same. However, people's expectations about consumption and using debt to finance it remained the same, so debt kept rising in the same way as wages flattened causing an increase in debt-to-income ratio. High debt-to-income ratios also skew towards lower-income groups. More people fell into debt crisis where they had more debt than they can afford, leading to the 2008 Great Recession.\n\nThis is all reinforced by an oligarchy of the 9.9 percent - Americans with a net worth of $1-10 million. This \"new aristocracy\" believes they are middle class, but live in nicest neighborhoods, send their kids to the best schools and have politics that has better benefits for high-income earners (i.e. tax breaks for the wealthy). They consistently pass this on to their kids. These all reinforce not just income inequality (Gini coefficient) but also low social mobility (intergenerational earnings elasticity, or IGE). The US went from 0.3 in the mid 19th century to 0.5, among the highest in the developed world. These values are correlated, i.e. \"The Gatsby Curve.\"\n\n\"It has taken less than one lifetime for the (never fully formed) meritocracy to evolve into a (fledgling) aristocracy.

The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, and the rise of Donald Trump each represents a group shouting, “Stop the ride, I want off.” Social media and celebrity culture are \"gasoline on a flame.\" This idea of \"this isn't working\" may be the new set of expectations.

Identify these early.\n- Atomic - run in a singular context vs Holistic - runs against a shared context\n- Triggered - happens on an event vs Continual - constant verification\n- Static - fixed result, i.e. pass/fail vs Dynamic - shifting definition of correctness based on context\n- Automated vs manual - verified by a person\n- Temporal - i.e. reminders over time\n- Emergent - identify them as they arise\n- Domain-specific\n- These ^ can be combined as part of operational incremental change\n\nIncremental change\n- Be able to change things in small increments\n- Development - microservices, building blocks, testability and operational - CI/CD, feature toggles\n- Hypothesis-driven development: rather than lots of up-front requirements, create MVP that you can build a hypothesis around, articulate what to test, what experiments can determine the results and what validating the hypothesis means for future application development.\n\nArchitectural coupling\n- Modularity \n- Components - physical packaging of modules, physical partitioning\n- modules - logical grouping\n- library - one kind of component, compile-time dependency, runs in the same memory address as calling code and communicates ia language function call mechanisms.\n- service - another type of component, runtime dependencies, runs in its own memory address and communicates via networking protocols.\n- architectural quantum: an independently deployable component with with functional cohesion which includes everything it needs to function properly.\n- Bounded context - isolation based on processes and contexts rather than shared artifacts or entities.\n- microservices - physical bounded contexts encapsulating everything that might change\n- key: determining quantum granularity and coupling between components given hard-to-break forces like transactions and functional cohesion\n- small quanta - faster change\n\nLayered architecture that focuses on the technical dimension causes coupling across layers that makes it difficult to make changes at the domain level.\n\nMicroservices\n- Modeled around the business domain/context/workflow - quantum reflects the bounded context\n- Hide implementation details - each domain forms a physical bounded context\n- Culture of automation - tests, CI/CD\n- Highly decentralized - share nothing, decrease coupling as much as possible, prefer duplication over coupling\n- Deployed independently\n- Isolate failure - within and in coordination between services\n- Highly observable - if you cannot monitor it, it might as well not exist\n\nEvolutionary Data\n- user expand/contract pattern for database refactoring\n- transactional contexts are a strong nuclear force binding architecture quanta\n\nPartitioning methods for decomposing monoliths:\n- Business functionality groups\n- Transactional boundaries\n- Deployment goals\n\nGuidelines for building evolutionary architectures\n- Remove needless variability - i.e. immutable infrastructure\n- Make decisions reversible - i.e. blue/green deployments, feature toggles\n- Prefer evolvable over predictable - dynamic equilibrium renders predictability useless\n- Build anticorruption layers - isolates from outside changes, allows you to defer decisions to the last responsible moment\n- Build sacrificial architectures - use PoCs, MVPs to prove things out\n- Mitigate external change - take a proactive approach to dependency management\n- Updating libraries vs frameworks - frameworks call developer's code, developer's code calls libraries. Libraries introduce less coupling.\n- Prefer continuous delivery to snapshots - use fitness functions to accommodate change\n- Version services internally - keep the interface the same, route requests based on the context of the caller\n\nPitfalls and anti-patterns\n- Vendor king - coupling to a vendor. Treat all software as another integration point\n- Leaky abstractions - all nontrivial transactions break. Try to monitor this with fitness functions\n- Last 10% trap - avoid hack-arounds that get you 80%-90% there when they can't solve the problem completely\n- Code reuse abuse - software reuse has hidden costs. The more reusable code is, the less usable it is - more reuse causes it to have to do more. Prefer duplication over reuse.\n- Resume-driven development - utilizing every new framework to enrich your resume\n- Inappropriate governance - i.e. centralization and shared services in a world where new services are cheap and where appropriate coupling is more important\n- Lack of speed to release - strong correlation between the ability to release software and the ability to evolve that software design. Measure with cycle time - time between the initiation and completion of a unit of work. A system can't evolve faster than its cycle time.\n- Product customization - selling features before determining the product has that feature\n- Reporting - trying to use same system for system of record and for reporting leads to a design optimized for neither.\n- Planning horizons - The larger the planning horizon without opportunity to revisit the plan means decisions are made with the least amount of information (i.e. the cone of uncertainty). Sunk cost fallacy - more time or effort you invest into something, the harder it is to abandon it. Don't become irrationally attached to artifacts. Avoid long planning cycles by breaking work into smaller pieces.\n\nPutting evolutionary architecture into practice\n- Cross-functional teams - Use domain-centric teams that have every project role embedded organized around business capabilities.\n- Product over project - teams stay associated with products rather than projects with an ending; product owners advocate for its use in the ecosystem; in cross-functional teams, each role needed by the product is represented. Helps build long-term vision to the team.\n- Dealing with external change - need architecture to isolate change, but services will need some integration points. Create fitness functions to protect from side effects of evolution, i.e. consumer-drive contracts.\n- Connections between team members - maintain fewer required connections between teams and team members\n\nTeam Coupling\n- Culture - encourage skills that lead to evolutionary architecture\n- Culture of experimentation - regularly try new ideas and integrate successful experiments into existing systems.\n\nCFO and Budgeting\n- As the number of quanta rises, the cost per quantum goes down until architecture reaches a sweet spot. Beyond that, the coordination costs drives benefit per quantum down.\n\nEnterprise architects\n- provide guidance around coupling points\n- defining enterprise-wide fitness functions\n\nWhere to start?\n- low-hanging fruit - easiest first, demonstrate value\n- highest value - show long-term value, vet the most complicated parts\n- testing - add critical tests, focus on high-level functional tests and TDD moving forward\n- infrastructure - precursor to evolutionary architecture\n\nFuture\n- Fitness functions using AI\n- generative testing\n\nWhy decide to use Evolutionary Architecture?\n- Predictable vs evolvable - takes more time, but is rewarded when the company can react to shifts in the marketplace without major rework.\n- Scale - being tied to one thing is the bottleneck\n- Advanced business capabilities - i.e. A/B testing, hypothesis-driven development\n- Cycle time as business metric - delivering faster is a competitive advantage\n- Isolating architectural characteristics at the quantum level - different characteristics per quantum, less analyzing of tradeoffs necessary.\n- Adaptation vs evolution - adaptation increases technical debt by layering functionality, evolution encourages changes in place protected by fitness functions\n- Less risk - more confidence making changes won't break the whole system\n\nWhy not?\n- Can't evolve a ball of mud - system needs to be modularized first to make the transition feasible\n- Other architectural characteristics dominate - i.e. speed, security\n- Sacrificial architecture - i.e. MVPs. Architects don't try to evolve it because it will be replaced\n- Planning on closing business soon\n\nConvincing others\n- Consulting judo - Solve a problem rather than discussing it to death and show that it works. \"Demonstration defeats discussion.\"","timeUpdated":"2019-03-06T12:49:13+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c7480b24302fe003904276f"},"timeCreated":"2019-02-25T23:56:34+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Hexagonal/ports \u0026 adapters/clean architecture\n\ngoal: isolate the business logic from the delivery mechanisms and tools used by the system\n\n- Edge services (application/framework layer)\n    - GraphQL/REST/Kafka/SQL?\n\n- Commands (use-cases)\n    - gRPC definitions?\n    - “A Use Case (Command) is an explicitly defined way in which an application can be used.”\n\n- Core business logic\n    - Plus supporting domain logic like domain events and command handlers\n\nDifferent types of adaptors\n- Primary or Driving Adapters - start some action on the application.

Went to game night after at the SLC office. Played Secret Hitler, Super Smash Bros and Camel Up. We found the espresso Stephen helped fund and he, Nick and Paul watched YouTube videos of how it worked. Nicole arrived at the airport while things were wrapping up. Derek invited us over for drinks and more games. His house is awesome and he has lots of guitars he has collected. I played for a bit. Derek made vodka ice cream. Morgan was there, too. Nicole got her rental and met us at Derek's house. We playes another round of Camel Up. I came in second place again. Went back to our hotel and said goodbye to the team.\n\n- Friday - checked out of the hotel and drove to Blue Copper for coffee. Nicole was impressed with the mountains. Drove to Temple Square and parked at the mall. Stopped in the Joseph Smith Memorial building (former hotel) and got an impromptu tour from and older LDS gentleman. He brought us up to the 10th floor and gave us lots of facts about SLC. He suggested going to The Rooftop for dinner so we made a reservation. Walked to the Copper Onion for lunch. Ran into Derek DeVries and the Perform team. Got burger and bhan mi for lunch. Walked back to Temple Square around the temple grounds. Meant to \"stop by\" the family genealogy center but ended up staying for hours. The staff (kids on their mission) help you use familyresearch.com to build a family tree. I rebuilt/confirmed the one from uncle Ricky and did more on grandma Jean's side and my mom's side. Then we went to the stacks and found some books on Ludlow history. Stopped into the LDS museum. The docent told us a bunch of bullshit about the golden plates. Went to the theater for an interactive history lesson about Joseph Smith. It was weird. Back to the hotel for a bit and then took. Lyft to dinner at the rooftop. It was fancy buffet overlooking the Temple. Worth the $100 for the weird experience. Dinner with no drinks!? Walked to White Horse for a cocktail then walked back to Airbnb.\n\nSaturday - coffee at Blue Copper. Drove to Antelope Island. The terrain was beautiful - grassy hills with small mountains close by and big mountains further out surrounded by the Great Salt Lake. Climbed up Buffalo Point for a short hike. Stood on the boulders. Saw a buffalo in the distance. Drove back to the main road then to the ranch about halfway down the island. Ate lunch in our car. Stopped at the visitor center on the way out. Drove back to the Airbnb to freshen up then headed out to Park City in the mountains. Walked around a bit and went into some fancy shops. Tried looking for High West distillery but ran into a guy who told us it was closed for \"mud season.\" Turns out he was a bar tender at a local bar so we went there instead. It was called the Cabin and all the people there were chefs at other places hanging out before third shift. We talked with the bartender for a while and he suggested we go to Flying Sushi and Freshies for dinner. Flying Sushi was great even though we don't love sushi. After sushi we drove through the neighborhoods a bit then to Freshies which won a Maine lobster roll contest. It was really, really good. They fly the lobster in fresh every day. Drove back to our Airbnb then rallied o get a drink at Water Witch. Seemed like a nice cocktail bar but a drunk guy was bothering us at the bar so we left. I figured out Tinwell (or Tinkwell as I like to call it) was around the corner so we went there. I had gone there earlier in the week with Dana and the Ark guys. There was techno music playing and a lot of people there. We sat at the bar and got a round of drinks.\n\nSunday - woke up to fire trucks stopping in front of our building. I went outside to see that the building down the block caught on fire. Spoke to fire fighters and they said someone probably lit it. We chatted with them for a bit and they suggested driving up the Canyon by the ski resorts. Had breakfast at Sweet Lake and it was amazing - egg chicken and biscuits and breakfast nachos with pulled pork. Took the drive up to Brighton through the canyon and it was gorgeous. The rocks are amazing. When we got to the top, it was 20 degrees colder and a snow storm. Stopped at Brighton and took a selfie in the snow. Drove back down for more amazing views. It was sunny and in the 50s at the base. Drove to the SLC Bees stadium and watched a game in our T-shirts. We stopped by the store and got Mike Trout gear for Emily Patrick. After the game we had some time to kill before our flight, so we got ice cream at one of the few places open - a truck called Normal Ice Cream inside a mall at Trolly Square. After that, went to the airport pretty early for our flight. Got to Portland and upgraded our car to a Subaru Crosstrek. Arrived at our AirBnB after 9 and stayed in.\n\nMonday - Had breakfast at a great little spot called Elephant Delicatessen. Then walked around a bit. Stopped by Powell's Books and then a donut at Voodoo Doughnuts. Walked along the river for a bit and got a slice of pizza at Chiosco. It was super cheap for Pizza Week. The pizza itself was ok - thick-ish crust with lots of grease. Stopped into the library where we saw a really cool tree sculpture - it had all sorts of imagery all over it that was simpler at the bottom where little kids could see and more complex near the top for the big kids. It was cast in bronze, so the parts that were touched more were more shiny. In our quest for a Portland Pickles hat, we stopped in the Portland Gear Store, which was a little too hip. Got to chatting with the girl who worked there who was ex-mormon from SLC. She recommended a few places to get a drink. After going to Powell's Books again to browser, we caught a Lyft to 10 Barrel Brewing and had a few beers and snacks. It was good and a nice place to hang while we waited for Shannon Lehotsky and her boyfriend to finish up work. Had one more drink at Tilt and tried to play table tennis with Nicole. After that, we got a Lyft across the river to Shannon and her boyfriend's mushroom jerky kitchen. They showed us their work and we sampled the goods. It was pretty tasty. They drove us to Pine Street Market, which is an old building with food stands like Chelsea Market or the Terminal. I got bulgogi and more beer. Tyler's friend Emily met us there, too, and we all had a good hang. We convinced them all to buy bidets for their toilets :) That place was close enough for us to walk home, but we stopped at a really weird bar called The Big Legrowlski. There was a jam session going on and it wasn't very good, but it was a nice stop for a drink. Walked wayyy up the hill back to our Airbnb in the bottom of Kings Heights area.\n\nTuesday - had breakfast at Elephant Delicatessen again. Stopped by a dispensary called Electric Lettuce to get us and Joni some edibles. Drove around a bit before heading out on our road trip to Port Townshend. We took the long route to the coast starting at Seaside where we took some photos of Haystack Rock. We had lunch at a seafood place near the water called Norma's Seafood \u0026 Steak. Then we drove up the coast through the forrest. The vegetation was beautiful. The evergreens and the moss create so many shades of green. Got to our cabin at the Chevy Chase house around 7:30. After we got settled, we went to Joni's to celebrate Bo's birthday. Her cabin was pretty deep in the woods down a very steep, gravel road. When I saw her, the first thing I thought was how much she looked like my Dad. She was very excited to see us and Bo was very friendly. We sang happy birthday to him and Joni got him a handle from the Chinese store that, when lit, spun around and played a song (they told us later that they had to smash it with a hammer to get it to stop). We chatted about life and family and had some wine before heading back to our cabin for the night.\n\nWednesday - Headed over to Joni's for breakfast. We had eggs and toast and drank coffee and had more chats about life and family. After breakfast, we drove to the marina with her. She showed us the boats she was working on. One was owned by an heir of the Dakota building in New York City. Another one that Bo is also working on is a super high-tech sailboat full of electronics and sound systems. They though that was stupid, but were happy to work on it. The interior was beautifully finished matte wood that had flourishes like hidden rivets and rounded edges. Bo did a lot of the interior woodwork. She also pointed out the boat she went to Alaska on (she also has sailed to Japan despite getting seasick and not knowing how to swim!). We met one of her neighbors who live in their boat and she let us inside - it was grungy and old, just like you would expect from an old boat. It had way more character than the others. After that we went into town to walk around in the little shops. Everyone new Joni and asked her how her business was going. In general, Joni seems to like the area, but is down on the gentrification and isn't into the craft or boat scene anymore. She was also a little upset about a few locals dying from drug overdoses or other tragedies, and wasn't super prepared to see all her friends. It was getting to be dinner time, so we headed back to her place. Bo came and helped make chicken on the grill while Joni made \"ball salad\" - tomato and fresh mozzarella, which are, indeed, all balls. We chatted and had beers. The food was delicious. Headed home as we all got tired from laughing at around 11pm.\n\nThursday - Joni and Bo met at our cabin to check the place out. We walked around the grounds and accidentally walked into a private cabin called \"The Clubhouse.\" It wasn't a clubhouse. Oops. Walked down to the water. After that, we headed to the other marina and had lunch at a restaurant called The Point Hudson Cafe. Then we said our goodbyes to Joni and Bo in the parking lot. It was a really nice visit with Joni. I feel a deep connection with her, differently than any other family members on that side. Nicole said later that she felt more proud to have the Blanchard last name after spending time with her.\n\nOn our way over to Seattle, we did some Twin Peaks tourism in and around Snoqualmie:\n- A parking lot of the police station set with the police truck. It's not a rally racing store.\n- The bridge where they found Ronette walking on the train tracks\n- Twede's Cafe, which was where the RR was filmed.\n- Snoqualmie falls where they filmed the opening and exterior shots of the Great Northern. That was a highlight, the falls were amazing.\n\nWe also discovered the amazing espresso stands on the side of the road all over that area. They look like weird shacks, but they are actually amazing coffee places with cool baristas.\n\nAfter that we headed to our Airbnb in Seattle. Got in around 8 and walked to Standard Brewing for a drink. Saw the typical Seattle crew there - Microsoft guys with VS Code gear and a few other guys complaining about working at Amazon. Went across the street to Reckless Noodle for a late-night snack and cocktail. Headed home for the night after that.\n\nFriday - Got coffee at the Broadcast Cafe. Looked like rain all day, so we optimized for inside things. Started at the Museum of Pop and saw exhibits on Prince, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, SciFi, Horror and guitars. It was pretty neat. Then we went to the Chihuly Garden to see his glass sculptures. A highlight was the glass blowing demo. After that, we got a drink at Some Random Bar (really, that's what it was called). Then we took a lift to dinner at Manolin. It was a pretty good seafood and cocktails bar. After that, we walked to the see the Fremont Troll and then back down to Fremont Brewing for a drink. From there, we wanted ice cream, so we Capitol Hill for Salt \u0026 Straw homemade ice cream. It was pretty tasty. Stopped into Unicorn bar but we decided we were too old for that place. On our way home, we found a bar with pizza, so we stopped there for a drink and a slice. Headed home after that to get ahead of the young crowd in Capitol Hill.","timeUpdated":"2019-05-01T00:48:01+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5cd01c206455bd0039deee6f"},"timeCreated":"2019-05-06T11:36:00+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Big News\n\nLast week on May 1st, we found out Nicole'e pregnant (!!!).

Babies came up in conversation and he asked me what out baby plan was. I laughed and said we're \"letting nature take its course.\" I can't wait to tell him I actually knew and it was extremely hard not to say anything. (At that game I also saw Michael Solomonov in the bathroom.

This means we can ship code faster and more confidently :sonicspeed: \n\nBefore tackling this work, we deployed new code in two week cycles. As a result, we could ship new features or bug fixes no sooner than when the next deploy cycle was scheduled, unless it was critical enough to get out sooner via a very, very terrible patch release process (if you’ve ever tried to wrap your head around a time travel movie that introduces multiple timelines with requisite time travel paradoxes, it was a little like that).\n\nWith continuous delivery, we are now deploying code multiple times per day with a process that’s fully automated. You may have noticed the benefits of this a few times already where *we’ve gotten fixes out to production within the hour that the problem was discovered*. This, paired with another successful project this quarter around monitoring and alerting, has dramatically reduced the blast radius of defects (in some cases, we may have fixed something before you even knew there was a problem :sneakysneaky:).\n\nTo my knowledge, we are only the second eng team in all of Instructure who has reached this level of deployment and observability sophistication.

I think this applies to a few decision points we have for Exercises:\u2028\u20281. EKS\n2. Aurora\n3. Language choices\u2028\u2028Here’s some notes from Chris along with the source of this governance model:\u2028\n```\nwhat are the components of a decision?\n\n* choice generation\n* choice selection\n* implementation\n* authorization\n* challenge\n\nwe shouldn't think about governance as binary: centralized or distributed.  rather, decision making can be comprised of centralized or distributed decisions at various points in the process (e.g., centralized choice generation but distributed choice selection).\n\nreference: https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-API-Management-Decisions-Landscape/dp/1492043559\n```\n\nSpecifically, what this means is a little up-in-the-air, but Chris would like us to start thinking about these roughly in this framework.\n\nWhat I think this might look like is:\u2028\n1. Bring the intent to expand the pool of possible choices to an appropriate guild via RFC (choice generation)\n2. Let the guild be a central body for questioning your intent to expand the pool of possible choices. This might result in more cycles of the RFC. (challenge)\n3. Once the guild give it the green light, the choice is added to the pool of possible choices and other teams are free to choose between them in a distributed manner (choice selection)\n\nIt might be worth connecting with Chris about this process, specifically:\n- Is this generally the application of this governance model that he’s expecting? How much has this been socialized with the rest of the org?\n- What kinds of things would he expect in the RFC for step #1?\n- This model addresses choice generation, challenge and choice selection. What about authorization and implementation?\n\nNext steps\n\n# EKS - I think we’re on the right track with this intention doc that I’m renaming as an RFC https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdAnjHafCQl-MRoSarJmo9vrAdCpG1dhVhs6bIuIpvk/edit#. @stephen - can you own bringing this to the infrastructure guild and getting some feedback from them? If that feels like it’s causing lots of issues and turning into an exercise in bike shedding, let’s give that feedback to Chris asap.\n\n# BE Language selection - @Paul - As you think about making this decision next week, can you own bringing it to the architecture guild? Same notes as above. Here’s the current choice selection for Bridge https://instructure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BE/pages/367558684/Bridge+Suite+Programming+Languages\u2028\u2028# FE language selection - I can own this when I get back. I’m still torn on this, but I’m actually leaning a bit back towards TypeScript… given this governance model, I think it’ll be an easier sell to the org and will have better parity with other JS tech stacks across the org at the moment. I’m not opposed to circling back this later, but I’m just not that comfortable with it myself to recommend it as a sanctioned choice selection and there’s enough unknowns elsewhere in FE architecture that I think it would put PI1 deliverables at risk to figure that out concurrently. Ask me about this again after a few glasses of wine on a beach in Portugal and I may feel differently.\n\n# Aurora - If we want to go this route, I think we’ll also want to run it by the infrastructure guild.\u2028\u2028If any of these guild meetings fall outside of our timeline for getting started with everything in PI1, that’s ok - I’m ok moving forward with some of these decisions without the rubber stamp of approval with the understanding that we should be in the processor getting  that approval and give ourselves an escape hatch to back out if we really need to.\n","timeUpdated":"2019-07-16T21:25:40+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d473449c6e3b7003a3f3d23"},"timeCreated":"2019-08-04T19:38:49+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Four Better Rules for Software Design\n\nBy David Bryant Copeland\n\nOriginal rules from Kent Beck:\n\n1.

I'm talking about UI components - not other frontend code units that are pure functions or isolate side-effects. Ideally, you are extracting these out of UI components and testing them in isolation with whatever unit testing stack works for you. This is just well-factored code - it has all sorts of side-benefits besides for testing.\n3. In general, don't just do what everyone else does because the internet is telling you that's what everyone is doing. I am currently one of those people on the internet.\n\nThree experiences:\n1. Years ago - someone wrote about how they don't unit test their rails controllers!\n2. Gary Bernhardt's \"Functional Core, Imperative Shell\" talk - made ^ makes sense - if controllers are, by definition, integration points of your other (tested) code, the unit is the integration and _that's_ what you should test (if at all).\n3. \"Testing Microservices, the sane way\" by Cindy Sridharan - this isn't about testing your frontend, but it got me thinking about how the old paradigms of testing may need to be challenged.\n- \"The main thrust of my argument wasn’t that unit testing is completely obviated by end-to-end tests, but that being able to correctly identify the “unit” under test might mean accepting that the unit test might resemble what’s traditionally perceived as “integration testing” involving communication over a network.\"\n- \"I coined the term “step-up testing”, the general idea being to test at one layer above what’s generally advocated for\"\n\nSo: I don't unit test my React UI components anymore. There. I said it.\n\nBUT - I tried, and it was not fun. Maybe I was doing it wrong, but tell me if this feels familiar:\n\nLet's unit test our UI components:\n\nHow do we run them?\n- Jest + JS DOM + enzyme (or some abstraction on top of react test utils)\n- \n\nWhat should we assert?\n- The inputs and outputs are less clear. Let's scope it to the public interfaces: props and the return value of the render function.\n- Inputs are pretty easy. How do we know the output is \"working\"?\n- We can check that certain elements are there, but isn't that an implementation detail?\n- LET'S TALK ABOUT PUBLIC INTERFACES - interlude\n- So given that ^ we can walk the DOM and check the stuff we expect to be there is there. But... there's a lot to assert should we just check everything? Let's try snapshot tests. Oh, 1,000 diffs. Ok. It's also checking the structure of our code, which we already decided isn't something we really care about.\n- What about behavior? We can do that, but it's not very ergonomic - have to simulate events. There might even be things we literally cannot reach, like modals.\n\nOverall, this ^ is not a great developer experience.\n- Have you ever TDD'd a component this way? Nope. It doesn't cover two crucial aspects of the public interface: 1) does it look weird? 2) does it behave weird?\n- The ROI doesn't seem worth it.\n\nI'm not saying we don't test, we just shouldn't unit test components in this way. So what do we do?\n\n1. Use architecture that makes your UI components so dumb that they aren't a likely source of bugs.\n- Extract all side-effects and pure data transformations to other places with simple inputs and outputs, unit test those. Your UI becomes a composition (i.e. an integration point) of those other, well tested things. Use whatever stack you want for this. Jest is fine.\n\n2. Just integration test everything together.\n- This seems crazy, but I think it just has more bang for your buck. Doesn't need to hit all remote collaborators, it's ok to mock some things out, like your API. But at the end of the day, THIS - going through entire flows in a real browser - is your public interface and you need to know if that's working.\n- There's also pretty good tooling for this - Cypress works really well. It's not perfect, but it has a great developer experience. Using Cypress is the first time I've ever enjoyed testing on the FE because it helps me write my code and gives me a high degree of confidence that the things are actually working.\n\n3. Filling in the gaps:\n- Make exploratory testing easy with a sandbox like Storybook.\n- Look for automation around ^ like asserting on some of the key story configurations, or visual regression tests with something like Chromatic.\n- My issue with unit testing UI components is that it's high effort, medium value, so if we can lower the effort it becomes more feasible.\n- Think about extracting or isolating your \"UI Kit\" to generic, living style guide. Remember what I said about library authors in the beginning - this may have its own unit testing strategy that makes you even more confident that applications that compose these well testing components are doing the right thing. And then don't double unit test them in the consumer!","timeUpdated":"2019-09-07T15:35:57+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d750634473f3c0039c92170"},"timeCreated":"2019-09-08T13:46:28+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"New jawn todos\n\n- tests for API\n- critical dependency updates\n- deploy somewhere\n- automation around spinning up entire cluster?\n- secrets management\n- automated backups\n\nNew stuff:\n- message bus + consumer showing velocity\n- Spinnaker?\n- email consumer","timeUpdated":"2019-09-08T14:29:15+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d77a1ccc6e3b7003a3f3d27"},"timeCreated":"2019-09-10T13:14:52+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Limitations of REST\n\n- Operating on collections\n- Operating on nested entities\n- Field optionality, either as part of the client interface or as a function of roles/permissions\n- Transformations with side-effects","timeUpdated":"2019-09-10T13:15:39+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d78fb22c6e3b7003a3f3d28"},"timeCreated":"2019-09-11T13:48:18+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Reasons to not standardize on Gerrit\n\n- GH has not only has parity with review flows, it's actually better. \n- We shouldn't be self hosting/maintaining this.\n- There's an opportunity cost behind Gerrit - GH is going to get better and better.\n- Onboarding - everyone is already familiar with GH, Gerrit needs to be documented and hand-held\n- We need GH in the org, anyway - we have some open source tooling.","timeUpdated":"2019-09-11T13:50:16+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d78fb31c6e3b7003a3f3d29"},"timeCreated":"2019-09-11T13:48:33+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Product maturity \n\nProduct maturity\n- Clear, consistent approach the prioritization: I think this is one of the most important but also challenging functions of a healthy product org\n- Better, more iterative pre-development design flow + collaboration with engineers through the entire process.

I can't figure him out and don't understand why he keeps being given more and more responsibilities.\n\nBen Bolton used a lot of my ideas and language, probably passed on to him via Chris Wyckoff. I don't mind, I'm glad to have been impactful, here.\n\n\n-----\n\nMy survey answers\n\nWhat went well? *\nIt was definitely valuable to have most of Bridge all in one room at one time. I think this is less useful for actual planning (there's not enough time and there's a bit of a \"too many cooks\" thing going on sometimes), but it's really helpful to get on the same page or identify sources of misalignment in realtime.\n\nWhat didn't go so well? *\nI still think we're missing a really important part of this process: when do we do idea generation, discovery, feasibility analysis, R\u0026D, etc? Are these things that can/should be pulled into a PI? Are we missing a similar concurrent, real-time experience earlier in the process to give devs visibility and opportunities to influence the product lifecycle? Given that this is a collaborative process between product and eng, how do we allocate eng resources to this if we have large, expensive, rigid, unwieldily \"scrum teams\" who fill up their full capacity every PI?\n\nWhat could we do differently next time? *\nWe really need to figure out when and how much to plan before PI. The sessions during PI planning are just not enough time to do this. I think you realistically need days or weeks to do this work, not like, 2 hours.\n\nMaybe one way to do this would be to have two swim lanes of work each PI - one for \"discovery phase\" projects and one for \"execution phase\" projects. Work in the former can flow into the latter if they are deemed worth investing in and there are groups of people dedicated to owning the different types of outputs in each.\n\nI think this would require us to re-think what a \"scrum team\" is. Right now, they are too big to do this ^ cost-effectively, and I don't think it can be tacked onto a subset of an existing team - I still feel strongly that multiple streams of work that don't have high cohesion within a scrum team is an antipattern.\n\nIf instead, you have two kinds of teams - small, cross-functional \"discovery teams\" (I'm talking real small - 1 or 2 devs + PM + designer) and bigger \"capacity teams\" that are more like the \"scrum teams\" we have now, you can allocate the small, cross-function teams to iterate on \"discovery phase\" projects (research, code spikes, MVPs, gathering data, etc) who can validate the idea before the org invests in it by handing it off to (or augmenting the small team with) a proper capacity team.\n\nThis might also solve a secondary problem where you have some devs who want to be involved in the problem definition and some just want to churn out code - in this model, there's a place for both.\n\nIt might even solve a tertiary problem where devs aren't bought into work that is handed off to them because it's not scoped right or isn't realistically feasible - if you have eng eyes on it early and a dev team hands it off to another dev team (or continues owning it with along with a bigger dev team), I think the \"capacity\"-style engineers will be more bought into it.\n\nI don't know what comes after tertiary, but yet another problem this might solve is allowing for people to cycle through different kinds of projects at different phases, which may keep them engaged and less likely to get bored or burnt out. Maybe one PI I'm on a \"discovery team,\" another I'm on a \"capacity team\" and I get different experiences in each.\n\nAdditional feedback?\nJane's comment about this feeling like it was facilitating coordination and not collaboration really resonated with me. It basically feels like a giant hand-off of tasks from the product org to the eng org and we (eng) don't get an opportunity to engage earlier in the process.\n\nThis is really important for a few reasons - 1. This is really inefficient for tackling complex, interdisciplinary problems like Bridge product/market fit. 2. There's a group of devs for whom proper collaboration is really important and that itch is not getting scratched right now. Equal to their hunger for more involvement end-to-end is their feeling disempowered by getting work thrown over the wall, putting our best eng talent at risk.\n\nI am not optimistic that Bridge will meet its goals if we don't solve this problem.

The value stream is decomposed into products (or something - more granular to a value stream, more coarse than a feature) which are aligned with teams.\n\nTeams are small, cross-functional units who own the product life cycle end-to-end in short cycles: ideation, exploration, rapid prototyping, developing, testing, deploying, iterating. Teams are allowed to self organize and work how they want, but they are always hyper-focused on measurable results. Members of a team may specialize (dev, PM, design, etc), but teams are composed of all the cross-functional roles they need to complete their work.\n\nEverything teams work on starts with the question of “what problem are we solving for whom and how will we measure success?” Teams welcome the constraint that time (the PI) and resources (the team) are fixed, but scope is adjustable. The team intuitively prioritizes work based on highest impact/lowest effort against these constraints.\n\nFeatures are composed of small, fit-for-purpose building blocks (aka microservices). Most changes are additive: new feature work mostly consists of interacting with the public APIs of existing services in new ways. When a feature requires new functionality, teams can add new services that extend or decorate existing functionality. Teams are disciplined about identifying building block abstractions and are empowered to create them before changing legacy code/creating implementations that add technical debt. The technical landscape is perfectly tailored to microservices - all necessary automation, monitoring and alerting is in place and comes out-of-the-box for new services. When teams need a new service to ship a feature, they are empowered and encouraged to do so. New services are so small that most engineers can understand them quickly and service ownership models are relaxed accordingly. Pageable events are minimized by the small surface area of each service; good monitoring, alerting and automation that gets ahead of most emergency scenarios. All engineers share the on-call rotation and regularly practice against staged scenarios.\nCurrent state of the world (vertical lines)\nProducts are entangled with coarse-grained legacy codebases. Teams are aligned with these codebases and projects usually involve making changes to their internals. The legacy codebases are in varying stages of maturity and most have some work associated with them (i.e. steps towards maturity, bugs, support tasks, high risk on-call rotations, etc). In other words, there’s a roadmap for each project that requires engineering resources.\n\nThe legacy codebases cause legacy mindsets: new features are reasoned about in terms of them, new work is perceived as slowed down by their technical debt, and they are leveraged inappropriately as de facto domain models because they are “at hand” as existing starting points.\nProblem\nThe current state of the world is orthogonal to the ideal end state. Attempting to fit one into the other is an exercise in futility. The backlogs associated with each are pulling in opposite directions: one further entrenching us in the legacy structures, the other trying to moving in new organizational and architectural directions. Having (and thinking in) legacy codebases will cause momentum to continue piling code into them, adding tech debt and reducing the ability to think in smaller, composable services. The backlogs in each legacy codebase isn’t owned by any one person, so there’s a “diffusion of ownership” that leads to difficulties prioritizing resolution of the root cause. At the same time, ongoing capacity dedicated to this work will prevent teams from fully immersing themselves into the value stream, creating resentment that the new structure isn’t working and reduced chance of success at reaching the ideal end state.\nTransition\nA transition strategy must have a concrete roadmap to move us from one structure to the other by:\n\nEliminating the roadmaps for legacy codebases.

However, in reality, we work differently.\n\nProduct and eng work on a project-based, handoff mode: Product owns the why/what, eng owns the how/when. Product works on discovery and design largely in isolation until they have work they want delivered. Their outputs are large requirements documents and expansive, high-fidelity mocks. This is the wide part of the green triangle above.\n\nOnce these artifacts are mostly complete, there is a product to eng handoff. This is where the green and blue triangles meet above. It usually looks like a brief “kickoff” meeting, maybe followed by a few more follow-up meetings after being given feedback. The goal of this period is to “lock in” the feature so that eng can estimate it and begin development (the wide blue part in the diagram above).\n\nThe need to “lock in” the design is driven by the large size of the project scope. It’s a protection mechanism so that delivery teams can accurately estimate and execute against that estimation. Iterations are only safe to happen in the small area where the green and blue lines meet -  any changes suggested after this period are seen as a threat to a) the dev team - because it impacts the delivery team’s ability to deliver against a predetermined commitment and b) to the product team - because it impacts their ability to ship a “successful” feature that’s already gone through some process of validation.\n\nIt’s difficult to discuss scope ahead of the kickoff because eng gets involved too late in the process. At “kickoff” time, too much work has gone into discovery and ideation which creates a sunk cost fallacy. Product/design are resistant to change because too much work has gone into the design phase and the cost of changes seem really high.\n\nFrom Product’s perspective, Eng’s desire to scope down the feature is perceived as a threat to the viability of the feature. From Eng’s perspective, viability hasn’t yet been rigorously proven, so devs aren’t bought into the value the feature will provide. It’s an endless cycle of mistrust.\n\nIn this process, we lose the “why” and start making decisions in irrational ways.\n\nScrum teams are also too big, unwieldy and eng-heavy. This increases communication costs and a desire to add more process to keep everyone informed, hurting the agility of the team. It also changes the dynamic of conversations with Product because Eng stakeholders so heavily outnumber Product/design stakeholders. The “handoff” model exacerbates the perceptions of these silos.\n\nOnce development finally kicks off, the Eng team and the Product team depart while the devs start building the solution and Product begins the cycle over again on a different, unrelated project. The more coarse-grained the feature is, the longer the functions operate separately, creating a chasm that only gets crossed when there’s a problem or for the next minimal handoff.\nIdeal end state\nIn the ideal end state, the idea of separate functional silos owning the “why/what” and the “how” are completely torn down. A small, nimble, tightly integrated, cross-functional team owns the “why/what/how” end-to-end. All are consistently engaged with the same workstream at all phases of the project: definition, building, testing, deploying, iterating.\n\nAll roles have work to do at each phase: early on, eng helps synthesize discovery results and works closely with PM and designer to iterate on designs. Early PoCs can even happen concurrently with design and be used to facilitate more discovery (i.e. putting actual UIs in front of customers to see how they interact with them before they have a backend. These can be throwaway or built on for actual implementation later). Devs work with PM to determine what data is available to help validate the feature. During feature development, devs constantly ship their progress to a WIP environment available to PM and designer. Designer is empowered to pull down the frontend code and make small suggestions or changes. PM can do the same, maybe even making small contributions to copy and other small tweaks. PM can also help test and continue to validate the work with hallway tests. All members of the team know the state of the feature at any point in time. This isn’t a function of over overly burdensome processes; rather, it happens organically because the entire team is engaged and focused on the same thing at the same time. The team is empowered to work however they need to work to achieve their goals.\n\nGoals are clearly communicated at each level of the process. Business objectives are clearly stated prior to PI planning. Leadership owns these goals. PI goals are a function of the business objectives and the value stream focus and are shared and agreed on at PI planning. Value streams own PI-level goals. Sprint goals are a function of the PI goals and the current state of the work (i.e. “Given where we are now and where we want to be, we need to do x, y and z next). Teams own sprint goals. Teams/Value Streams/LoBs effectiveness is measured against these goals, not in a punitive way, but in an experimental way, i.e. teams may not always reach the goals they set for themselves, but they should continuously strive to improve and get more effective over time.\n\nIn this model, the relationship between eng and product looks more like this:\n\n\n\nSmaller, tighter feedback loops, and more overlap between the roles. In fact, the colors are there merely to show how it relates to the previous model. Ideally, those colors blend into shared responsibilities within the team.\n","timeUpdated":"2019-11-05T15:52:10+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5dc19aabd0a9aa0039024ac5"},"timeCreated":"2019-11-05T15:52:11+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Notes on Org Structure \u0026 Team Empowerment\n\nBridge is composed of really talented people. The goal of an organizational structure is to make sure the talented people are aligned and making the most impact. This involves some level of control to make sure people/teams are working on the right thing at the right time given their abilities and the larger business strategy.\n\nThere’s two approaches to control:\n\nTop-down power\nDistributed empowerment\n\nThese are not necessarily mutually exclusive and fall on opposite sides of a spectrum.\nImpact of being too far on the side of top-down power\nFrom the individual contributor’s perspective, top-down power looks like:\nRules\nProcesses\nHierarchies\n\nPeople are incentivized to conform to the rules because that’s how success is measured in the org. The opposite is also true: working against the grain is disincentivized through fear and lack of means to get buy-in. This creates a tension between reining in things in via conventions, etc. vs learning and exploration. Fear of transgression leads to obfuscation of blame through discussing things to death and design by committee. The difficulty of finding consensus leads to continuous stalemate and lack of forward momentum.\n\nAs a result, people who have an aptitude for new ideas get disengaged, promoted or pushed out resulting in a diffusion of talent. Decisions default to what is familiar or most at hand, not because it’s proven to be effective, but because that’s the path of least resistance.\n\nIn LPMA language, this form of leadership heightens an organization’s sense of conformity which is inversely correlated with other desirable characteristics of a healthy org, like sense of responsibility. Responsibility is related to risk taking: “The higher Responsibility is perceived, the more willing individuals are to take calculated risks.” An organization fearful of calculated risks is an organization bound for stagnation.\nAffordances of Distributed Empowerment\nInstead of more mechanisms for control, distributed empowerment gives everyone more autonomy and ownership. Paired with a clear vision, a culture of learning, being open to guidance as well as frequent communication with the larger group, this structure could inject the organization with a sense of responsibility, clarity and high standards associated with healthy teams.\n\nThis doesn’t mean anarchy where everyone moves in different directions. Rather, it’s a more emergent approach to consensus-building. Being more tolerant of diverse ideas and opinions lets the best ideas win. It’s an evolutionary approach to organizational structure: more mindshare creates diversity of thought and the ecosystem converges on the best ideas.\n\nStandards and direction can also be influenced by a more deliberate approach to learning and growth. Influential technical leaders (formal and informal) can create and/or share content that nudges the org in a certain direction through enlightenment. Devs could be designated as evangelists for tooling or design patterns that leadership wants to promote. Formal training programs or curricula that embodies our shared core values could be circulated and encouraged as part of a career ladder.\nOverall, people need to feel safe that they can learn and innovate in meaningful ways.\nBut… we’ve tried this before and it doesn’t work\nBased on conversations I’ve had, I think Instructure’s been burned before by giving isolated teams more autonomy. My take on these cases is that these teams were too isolated, for too long, were too big and built things that were too big, and there never was an incentive to build interoperable/modular things.\n\nThe result is similar to what happens when you have a long-running feature branch: the longer that fork exists and the bigger it gets, the harder it is to merge back into the master branch. In this case, the industry-standard solution is smaller feature branches with more frequent integration points, which is very similar to what we’re advocating for with a more distributed org structure: smaller teams with more autonomy working on smaller stuff with more frequent integration points.\n\nSmaller teams and smaller services is the cornerstone to this: Smaller teams buy us: 1) more focus/ownership on an outcome as well as 2) a dependency on other teams to achieve the bigger picture outcomes which incentivize people to build more interoperable and modular things as well as have more communication w/ and motivation to play along with others, leading to more emergent standards and consistencies.\nSchuylkill as a case study\nFor Schuylkill, this came naturally. Our team culture grew out of a startup (Practice) that had to have a strong culture of ownership to survive. The only rules we followed were the rules we created for ourselves and we had to trust each other to follow them. We naturally had a lot of autonomy and freedom and held ourselves to a high standard.\n\nThrough teamwork, ownership, trust and experience, we found a balance between thoughtful considerations about getting work done and taking the time for critical thinking about doing work the right way vs doing what’s most expedient or at hand.\n\nThis experience has allowed us to build a brand within Instructure as being a high performing, innovative team. However, for us, it has felt like the things which make us special are at odds with an organization trying to standardize and find efficiencies through a more top-down power-oriented approach. We’ve tried to reconcile this tension by embedding ourselves in the existing structure and trying to meld out culture with the best parts of Instructure. However, this is a hard balance to strike: how can we share what’s working for our team with the larger org without the org draining it out of us?\nLeveraging architecture\nThe ability to match technical architecture to this organizational structure is a force multiplier for distributed empowerment. Building things in smaller, more composable pieces:\n\n\nForces integration conversations at the service boundaries\nMinimizes the risks of experimentation - smaller services are easier to spin up, tear down, remove or re-write.\nCreates opportunities for ownership - it’s possible for devs to get leadership experience by owning a smaller, less critical system.\n","timeUpdated":"2019-11-05T15:52:31+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5dc19ac2d0a9aa0039024ac6"},"timeCreated":"2019-11-05T15:52:34+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Call with Nestor\n\nPaths:\n- Double down on management track, get to director\n- Move to small/midsize company\n- Another big company?\n\nThe middle of ^ is the hardest part\n- “I chose it, I’ve struggled with it, but it was the right choice for me.”\n\n\nOptimize for how hands-on do you want to be?\n\n\nSmaller companies will excelerate faster\n- Less money\n\nGoals:\u20281.

Building quality into the development processes can happen through consistency, explicit architectural guiding principles, code reviews/pair programming, and tests/linters/type systems.\n\nIt's important to ship early and often so that the team is getting real production traffic and you are continuously delivering value to (and getting feedback from) the customer. Teams should strive to prevent defects in production, but continuous delivery helps to minimize the mean time to resolution, changing the risk profile when defects (inevitably) end up making it through all the gates.\n\nLastly, once code is in production, observability into the running system helps ensure that it is healthy and working as expected. This includes alerting on the \"Four Golden Signals\" (latency, traffic, errors, and saturation), \"white-box\" monitoring that gives engineers more insight into what's happening in the system's internals, and searchable log aggregation.\n\n\u003e What are the tools/skills utilized to successfully manage a remote group? *\n\nI believe trust and communication are the most fundamental elements of an effective team. Any tools or activities used to manage a remote group should be in service of these two things. Additionally, they are self-reinforcing: without trust, communication is strained; without communication, you can't build trust.\n\nIn remote settings, communication is less natural, so you have to be more intentional about building relationships and creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nSlack, GitHub PRs and other text-based communication tools can be an effective way to quickly send information back-and-forth and get things done. However, chat can easily become a distraction and context can easily get lost in text, especially when the discussion becomes complex or emotionally charged. I always encourage my team to be mindful of a tool's communication limitations and jump on synchronous video calls to resolve these kinds of conversations when they arise.\n\nI also like to create opportunities for off-task conversations that build relationships such as open office hours over video chat, or \"coffee breaks\" where we randomly pair two people together to meet on video chat and talk about whatever they want. I also like doing lunch-and-learns where people are empowered to teach others something they have learned on a regular cadence.\n\nLastly, periodic face-to-face time helps make remote time more natural. If the budget allows, I like to co-locate teams at least once a year to fill in any relationship gaps that don't break through the screen.","timeUpdated":"2020-01-11T20:00:25+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5e1c77c4d0a9aa0039024ad1"},"timeCreated":"2020-01-13T13:59:32+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"The Hobbit\n\n\"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\"","timeUpdated":"2020-01-13T13:59:58+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5e2e19c7d0a9aa0039024ad2"},"timeCreated":"2020-01-26T22:59:19+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"SRE Handbook\n\n\"Through this lens, then, we see that if software engineering tends to focus on designing and building software systems, there must be another discipline that focuses on the whole lifecycle of software objects, from inception, through deployment and operation, refinement, and eventual peaceful decommissioning.

I’m so sorry you and your team had to be a part of such a dramatic change.  That said, I know you’ve been outstanding in your efforts to calm people down, empathize, clarify, and lead throughout the day.  I appreciate all of your hard work managing difficult conversations with people affected and unaffected by the layoff.  I’m reminded of a Teddy Roosevelt quote that Brene Brown has made much use of:\n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.\n\nI’m not interested in pointing out critics or taking credit for being in the arena.  I simply like the metaphor of the arena for where we as a leadership team operate.  What we do is imperfect, but the fact that we’re out there doing it -- guiding and improving our teams, managing them through change, all while getting scraped and bruised in the process -- is remarkably important.  Jason, your work on Wednesday and for the next several days is sad and difficult, but it is also courageous.  And I can’t thank you enough for that.\n\n-Chris\n\n----\n\nAnd then for my new role:\n\nHey folks,\n\nI’m happy to announce that Jason Blanchard will be the new team lead for the Bridge SRE team.  Jason is an excellent leader and an outstanding engineer with a devops bent.  In the near term, he will be working directly with the team to provide continuity with things currently in flight while helping to prepare the team for the upcoming PI planning.  Over the long term, Jason will help drive the Bridge Independence initiative and continue our efforts to standardize Bridge infrastructure.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Jason.  This is a very impactful position that will help shape Bridge's technical landscape this year and beyond.  Jason has done an outstanding job leading Schuylkill, and I know he will do a great job in this expanded role.\n\n-Chris","timeUpdated":"2020-02-02T17:19:01+00:00"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5e41d9b4d0a9aa0039024ad4"},"timeCreated":"2020-02-10T22:31:16+00:00","userId":"58759d46f36d285ed998f155","__v":0,"text":"Levels of Ownership at Netflix\n\n0.
